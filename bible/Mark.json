[[{"p":1,"t":"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God."},{"p":1,"t":"As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, “<b>Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,</b> <b>who will prepare your way,</b>"},{"p":2,"t":"<b>the voice of one shouting in the wilderness,</b> ‘<b>Prepare the way for the Lord,</b> <b>make</b> <b>his paths straight.</b>’”"},{"p":3,"t":"In the wilderness John the baptizer began preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins."},{"p":3,"t":"People from the whole Judean countryside and all of Jerusalem were going out to him, and he was baptizing them in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins."},{"p":3,"t":"John wore a garment made of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey."},{"p":3,"t":"He proclaimed, “One more powerful than I am is coming after me; I am not worthy to bend down and untie the strap of his sandals."},{"p":3,"t":"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”"},{"p":4,"t":"Now in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River."},{"p":4,"t":"And just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens splitting apart and the Spirit descending on him like a dove."},{"p":4,"t":"And a voice came from heaven: “You are my one dear Son; in you I take great delight.”"},{"p":4,"t":"The Spirit immediately drove him into the wilderness."},{"p":4,"t":"He was in the wilderness forty days, enduring temptations from Satan. He was with wild animals, and angels were ministering to his needs."},{"p":5,"t":"Now after John was imprisoned, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God."},{"p":5,"t":"He said, “The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the gospel!”"},{"p":5,"t":"As he went along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen)."},{"p":5,"t":"Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will turn you into fishers of people.”"},{"p":5,"t":"They left their nets immediately and followed him."},{"p":5,"t":"Going on a little farther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother in their boat mending nets."},{"p":5,"t":"Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him."},{"p":6,"t":"Then they went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach."},{"p":6,"t":"The people there were amazed by his teaching, because he taught them like one who had authority, not like the experts in the law."},{"p":6,"t":"Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,"},{"p":6,"t":"“Leave us alone, Jesus the Nazarene!

Come out of him!”"},{"p":6,"t":"After throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him."},{"p":6,"t":"They were all amazed so that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him.”"},{"p":6,"t":"So the news about him spread quickly throughout all the region around Galilee."},{"p":7,"t":"Now as soon as they left the synagogue, they entered Simon and Andrew’s house, with James and John."},{"p":7,"t":"Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down, sick with a fever, so they spoke to Jesus at once about her."},{"p":7,"t":"He came and raised her up by gently taking her hand. Then the fever left her and she began to serve them."},{"p":7,"t":"When it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all who were sick and demon-possessed."},{"p":7,"t":"The whole town gathered by the door."},{"p":7,"t":"So he healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. But he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him."},{"p":8,"t":"Then Jesus got up early in the morning when it was still very dark, departed, and went out to a deserted place, and there he spent time in prayer."},{"p":8,"t":"Simon and his companions searched for him."},{"p":8,"t":"When they found him, they said, “Everyone is looking for you.”"},{"p":8,"t":"He replied, “Let us go elsewhere, into the surrounding villages, so that I can preach there too. For that is what I came out here to do.”"},{"p":8,"t":"So he went into all of Galilee preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons."},{"p":9,"t":"Now a leper came to him and fell to his knees, asking for help. “If you are willing, you can make me clean,” he said."},{"p":9,"t":"Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be clean!”"},{"p":9,"t":"The leprosy left him at once, and he was clean."},{"p":9,"t":"Immediately Jesus sent the man away with a very strong warning."},{"p":9,"t":"He told him, “See that you do not say anything to anyone, but go, show yourself to a priest, and bring the offering that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”"},{"p":9,"t":"But as the man went out he began to announce it publicly and spread the story widely, so that Jesus was no longer able to enter any town openly but stayed outside in remote places. Still they kept coming to him from everywhere."}],[{"p":1,"t":"Now after some days, when he returned to Capernaum, the news spread that he was at home."},{"p":1,"t":"So many gathered that there was no longer any room, not even by the door, and he preached the word to them."},{"p":1,"t":"Some people came bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them."},{"p":1,"t":"When they were not able to bring him in because of the crowd, they removed the roof above Jesus. Then, after tearing it out, they lowered the stretcher the paralytic was lying on."},{"p":1,"t":"When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”"},{"p":1,"t":"Now some of the experts in the law were sitting there, turning these things over in their minds:"},{"p":1,"t":"“Why does this man speak this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”"},{"p":1,"t":"Now immediately, when Jesus realized in his spirit that they were contemplating such thoughts, he said to them, “Why are you thinking such things in your hearts?"},{"p":1,"t":"Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up, take your stretcher, and walk’?"},{"p":1,"t":"But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” &#8211; he said to the paralytic &#8211;"},{"p":1,"t":"“I tell you, stand up, take your stretcher, and go home.”"},{"p":1,"t":"And immediately the man stood up, took his stretcher, and went out in front of them all. They were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”"},{"p":2,"t":"Jesus went out again by the sea. The whole crowd came to him, and he taught them."},{"p":2,"t":"As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax booth. “Follow me,” he said to him. And he got up and followed him."},{"p":2,"t":"As Jesus was having a meal in Levi’s home, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him."},{"p":2,"t":"When the experts in the law and the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”"},{"p":2,"t":"When Jesus heard this he said to them, “Those who are healthy don’t need a physician, but those who are sick do. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”"},{"p":3,"t":"Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. So they came to Jesus and said, “Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?”"},{"p":3,"t":"Jesus said to them, “The wedding guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them, can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they do not fast."},{"p":3,"t":"But the days are coming when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and at that time they will fast."},{"p":3,"t":"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise, the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and the tear becomes worse."},{"p":3,"t":"And no one pours new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be destroyed. Instead new wine is poured into new wineskins.”"},{"p":4,"t":"Jesus was going through the grain fields on a Sabbath, and his disciples began to pick some heads of wheat as they made their way."},{"p":4,"t":"So the Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is against the law on the Sabbath?”"},{"p":4,"t":"He said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions were hungry &#8211;"},{"p":4,"t":"how he entered the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the sacred bread, which is against the law for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to his companions?”"},{"p":4,"t":"Then he said to them, “The Sabbath was made for people, not people for the Sabbath."},{"p":4,"t":"For this reason the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"Then Jesus entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a withered hand."},{"p":1,"t":"They watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they could accuse him."},{"p":1,"t":"So he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Stand up among all these people.”"},{"p":1,"t":"Then he said to them, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or evil, to save a life or destroy it?” But they were silent."},{"p":1,"t":"After looking around at them in anger, grieved by the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored."},{"p":1,"t":"So the Pharisees went out immediately and began plotting with the Herodians, as to how they could assassinate him."},{"p":2,"t":"Then Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him. And from Judea,"},{"p":2,"t":"Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan River, and around Tyre and Sidon a great multitude came to him when they heard about the things he had done."},{"p":2,"t":"Because of the crowd, he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him so the crowd would not press toward him."},{"p":2,"t":"For he had healed many, so that all who were afflicted with diseases pressed toward him in order to touch him."},{"p":2,"t":"And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.”"},{"p":2,"t":"But he sternly ordered them not to make him known."},{"p":3,"t":"Now Jesus went up the mountain and called for those he wanted, and they came to him."},{"p":3,"t":"He appointed twelve (whom he named apostles), so that they would be with him and he could send them to preach"},{"p":3,"t":"and to have authority to cast out demons."},{"p":3,"t":"He appointed twelve: To Simon he gave the name Peter;"},{"p":3,"t":"to James and his brother John, the sons of Zebedee, he gave the name Boanerges (that is, “sons of thunder”);"},{"p":3,"t":"and Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,"},{"p":3,"t":"and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him."},{"p":4,"t":"Now Jesus went home, and a crowd gathered so that they were not able to eat."},{"p":4,"t":"When his family heard this they went out to restrain him, for they said, “He is out of his mind.”"},{"p":4,"t":"The experts in the law who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and, “By the ruler of demons he casts out demons.”"},{"p":4,"t":"So he called them and spoke to them in parables: “How can Satan cast out Satan?"},{"p":4,"t":"If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom will not be able to stand."},{"p":4,"t":"If a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand."},{"p":4,"t":"And if Satan rises against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand and his end has come."},{"p":4,"t":"But no one is able to enter a strong man’s house and steal his property unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can thoroughly plunder his house."},{"p":4,"t":"I tell you the truth, people will be forgiven for all sins, even all the blasphemies they utter."},{"p":4,"t":"But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven, but is guilty of an eternal sin”"},{"p":4,"t":"(because they said, “He has an unclean spirit”)."},{"p":5,"t":"Then Jesus’ mother and his brothers came. Standing outside, they sent word to him, to summon him."},{"p":5,"t":"A crowd was sitting around him and they said to him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.”"},{"p":5,"t":"He answered them and said, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”"},{"p":5,"t":"And looking at those who were sitting around him in a circle, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!"},{"p":5,"t":"For whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"Again he began to teach by the lake. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the lake and sat there while the whole crowd was on the shore by the lake."},{"p":1,"t":"He taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching said to them:"},{"p":1,"t":"“Listen! A sower went out to sow."},{"p":1,"t":"And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it."},{"p":1,"t":"Other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep."},{"p":1,"t":"When the sun came up it was scorched, and because it did not have sufficient root, it withered."},{"p":1,"t":"Other seed fell among the thorns, and they grew up and choked it, and it did not produce grain."},{"p":1,"t":"But other seed fell on good soil and produced grain, sprouting and growing; some yielded thirty times as much, some sixty, and some a hundred times.”"},{"p":1,"t":"And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear had better listen!”"},{"p":2,"t":"When he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables."},{"p":2,"t":"He said to them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those outside, everything is in parables,"},{"p":3,"t":"so that <b>although they look they may look but not see,</b> <b>and although they hear they may hear but not understand,</b> <b>so they may not repent and be forgiven</b>.”"},{"p":4,"t":"He said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? Then how will you understand any parable?"},{"p":4,"t":"The sower sows the word."},{"p":4,"t":"These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: Whenever they hear, immediately Satan comes and snatches the word that was sown in them."},{"p":4,"t":"These are the ones sown on rocky ground: As soon as they hear the word, they receive it with joy."},{"p":4,"t":"But they have no root in themselves and do not endure. Then, when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away."},{"p":4,"t":"Others are the ones sown among thorns: They are those who hear the word,"},{"p":4,"t":"but worldly cares, the seductiveness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it produces nothing."},{"p":4,"t":"But these are the ones sown on good soil: They hear the word and receive it and bear fruit, one thirty times as much, one sixty, and one a hundred.”"},{"p":5,"t":"He also said to them, “A lamp isn’t brought to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? Isn’t it to be placed on a lampstand?"},{"p":5,"t":"For nothing is hidden except to be revealed, and nothing concealed except to be brought to light."},{"p":5,"t":"If anyone has ears to hear, he had better listen!”"},{"p":5,"t":"And he said to them, “Take care about what you hear. The measure you use will be the measure you receive, and more will be added to you."},{"p":5,"t":"For whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.”"},{"p":6,"t":"He also said, “The kingdom of God is like someone who spreads seed on the ground."},{"p":6,"t":"He goes to sleep and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how."},{"p":6,"t":"By itself the soil produces a crop, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head."},{"p":6,"t":"And when the grain is ripe, he sends in the sickle because the harvest has come.”"},{"p":7,"t":"He also asked, “To what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to present it?"},{"p":7,"t":"It is like a mustard seed that when sown in the ground, even though it is the smallest of all the seeds in the ground &#8211;"},{"p":7,"t":"when it is sown, it grows up, becomes the greatest of all garden plants, and grows large branches so that the wild birds can nest in its shade.”"},{"p":8,"t":"So with many parables like these, he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear."},{"p":8,"t":"He did not speak to them without a parable. But privately he explained everything to his own disciples."},{"p":9,"t":"On that day, when evening came, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s go across to the other side of the lake.”"},{"p":9,"t":"So after leaving the crowd, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat, and other boats were with him."},{"p":9,"t":"Now a great windstorm developed and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was nearly swamped."},{"p":9,"t":"But he was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. They woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are about to die?”"},{"p":9,"t":"So he got up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Be quiet! Calm down!” Then the wind stopped, and it was dead calm."},{"p":9,"t":"And he said to them, “Why are you cowardly? Do you still not have faith?”"},{"p":9,"t":"They were overwhelmed by fear and said to one another, “Who then is this? Even the wind and sea obey him!”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"So they came to the other side of the lake, to the region of the Gerasenes."},{"p":1,"t":"Just as Jesus was getting out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came from the tombs and met him."},{"p":1,"t":"He lived among the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain."},{"p":1,"t":"For his hands and feet had often been bound with chains and shackles, but he had torn the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces. No one was strong enough to subdue him."},{"p":1,"t":"Each night and every day among the tombs and in the mountains, he would cry out and cut himself with stones."},{"p":1,"t":"When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down before him."},{"p":1,"t":"Then he cried out with a loud voice, “Leave me alone, Jesus, Son of the Most High God! I implore you by God &#8211; do not torment me!”"},{"p":1,"t":"(For Jesus had said to him, “Come out of that man, you unclean spirit!”)"},{"p":1,"t":"Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”"},{"p":1,"t":"He begged Jesus repeatedly not to send them out of the region."},{"p":1,"t":"There on the hillside, a great herd of pigs was feeding."},{"p":1,"t":"And the demonic spirits begged him, “Send us into the pigs. Let us enter them.”"},{"p":1,"t":"Jesus gave them permission. So the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs. Then the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake, and about two thousand were drowned in the lake."},{"p":2,"t":"Now the herdsmen ran off and spread the news in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened."},{"p":2,"t":"They came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind &#8211; the one who had the “Legion” &#8211; and they were afraid."},{"p":2,"t":"Those who had seen what had happened to the demon-possessed man reported it, and they also told about the pigs."},{"p":2,"t":"Then they asked Jesus to leave their region."},{"p":2,"t":"As he was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed asked if he could go with him."},{"p":2,"t":"But Jesus did not permit him to do so. Instead, he said to him, “Go to your home and to your people and tell them what the Lord has done for you, that he had mercy on you.”"},{"p":2,"t":"So he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what Jesus had done for him, and all were amazed."},{"p":3,"t":"When Jesus had crossed again in a boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him, and he was by the sea."},{"p":3,"t":"Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came up, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet."},{"p":3,"t":"He asked him urgently, “My little daughter is near death. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may be healed and live.”"},{"p":3,"t":"Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around him."},{"p":4,"t":"Now a woman was there who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years."},{"p":4,"t":"She had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all that she had. Yet instead of getting better, she grew worse."},{"p":4,"t":"When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,"},{"p":4,"t":"for she kept saying, “If only I touch his clothes, I will be healed.”"},{"p":4,"t":"At once the bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease."},{"p":4,"t":"Jesus knew at once that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothes?”"},{"p":4,"t":"His disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing against you and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”"},{"p":4,"t":"But he looked around to see who had done it."},{"p":4,"t":"Then the woman, with fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth."},{"p":4,"t":"He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your disease.”"},{"p":5,"t":"While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter has died. Why trouble the teacher any longer?”"},{"p":5,"t":"But Jesus, paying no attention to what was said, told the synagogue ruler, “Do not be afraid; just believe.”"},{"p":5,"t":"He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James."},{"p":5,"t":"They came to the house of the synagogue ruler where he saw noisy confusion and people weeping and wailing loudly."},{"p":5,"t":"When he entered he said to them, “Why are you distressed and weeping? The child is not dead but asleep.”"},{"p":5,"t":"And they began making fun of him. But he put them all outside and he took the child’s father and mother and his own companions and went into the room where the child was."},{"p":5,"t":"Then, gently taking the child by the hand, he said to her, “Talitha koum,” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up.”"},{"p":5,"t":"The girl got up at once and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). They were completely astonished at this."},{"p":5,"t":"He strictly ordered that no one should know about this, and told them to give her something to eat."}],[{"p":1,"t":"Now Jesus left that place and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him."},{"p":1,"t":"When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue. Many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did he get these ideas? And what is this wisdom that has been given to him? What are these miracles that are done through his hands?"},{"p":1,"t":"Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And aren’t his sisters here with us?” And so they took offense at him."},{"p":1,"t":"Then Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, and among his relatives, and in his own house.”"},{"p":1,"t":"He was not able to do a miracle there, except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them."},{"p":1,"t":"And he was amazed because of their unbelief. Then he went around among the villages and taught."},{"p":2,"t":"Jesus called the twelve and began to send them out two by two. He gave them authority over the unclean spirits."},{"p":2,"t":"He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff &#8211; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts &#8211;"},{"p":2,"t":"and to put on sandals but not to wear two tunics."},{"p":2,"t":"He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the area."},{"p":2,"t":"If a place will not welcome you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”"},{"p":2,"t":"So they went out and preached that all should repent."},{"p":2,"t":"They cast out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them."},{"p":3,"t":"Now King Herod heard this, for Jesus’ name had become known. Some were saying, “John the baptizer has been raised from the dead, and because of this, miraculous powers are at work in him.”"},{"p":3,"t":"Others said, “He is Elijah.” Others said, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets from the past.”"},{"p":3,"t":"But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised!”"},{"p":3,"t":"For Herod himself had sent men, arrested John, and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because Herod had married her."},{"p":3,"t":"For John had repeatedly told Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”"},{"p":3,"t":"So Herodias nursed a grudge against him and wanted to kill him. But she could not"},{"p":3,"t":"because Herod stood in awe of John and protected him, since he knew that John was a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard him, he was thoroughly baffled, and yet he liked to listen to John."},{"p":4,"t":"But a suitable day came, when Herod gave a banquet on his birthday for his court officials, military commanders, and leaders of Galilee."},{"p":4,"t":"When his daughter Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you.”"},{"p":4,"t":"He swore to her, “Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.”"},{"p":4,"t":"So she went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” Her mother said, “The head of John the baptizer.”"},{"p":4,"t":"Immediately she hurried back to the king and made her request: “I want the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.”"},{"p":4,"t":"Although it grieved the king deeply, he did not want to reject her request because of his oath and his guests."},{"p":4,"t":"So the king sent an executioner at once to bring John’s head, and he went and beheaded John in prison."},{"p":4,"t":"He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother."},{"p":4,"t":"When John’s disciples heard this, they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb."},{"p":5,"t":"Then the apostles gathered around Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught."},{"p":5,"t":"He said to them, “Come with me privately to an isolated place and rest a while” (for many were coming and going, and there was no time to eat)."},{"p":5,"t":"So they went away by themselves in a boat to some remote place."},{"p":5,"t":"But many saw them leaving and recognized them, and they hurried on foot from all the towns and arrived there ahead of them."},{"p":5,"t":"As Jesus came ashore he saw the large crowd and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he taught them many things."},{"p":6,"t":"When it was already late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is an isolated place and it is already very late."},{"p":6,"t":"Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy something for themselves to eat.”"},{"p":6,"t":"But he answered them, “You give them something to eat.” And they said, “Should we go and buy bread for two hundred silver coins and give it to them to eat?”"},{"p":6,"t":"He said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” When they found out, they said, “Five &#8211; and two fish.”"},{"p":6,"t":"Then he directed them all to sit down in groups on the green grass."},{"p":6,"t":"So they reclined in groups of hundreds and fifties."},{"p":6,"t":"He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. He gave them to his disciples to serve the people, and he divided the two fish among them all."},{"p":6,"t":"They all ate and were satisfied,"},{"p":6,"t":"and they picked up the broken pieces and fish that were left over, twelve baskets full."},{"p":6,"t":"Now there were five thousand men who ate the bread."},{"p":7,"t":"Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dispersed the crowd."},{"p":7,"t":"After saying good-bye to them, he went to the mountain to pray."},{"p":7,"t":"When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea and he was alone on the land."},{"p":7,"t":"He saw them straining at the oars, because the wind was against them.

Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles him.”"},{"p":5,"t":"[[EMPTY]]"},{"p":5,"t":"Now when Jesus had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable."},{"p":5,"t":"He said to them, “Are you so foolish? Don’t you understand that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him?"},{"p":5,"t":"For it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and then goes out into the sewer.” (This means all foods are clean.)"},{"p":5,"t":"He said, “What comes out of a person defiles him."},{"p":5,"t":"For from within, out of the human heart, come evil ideas, sexual immorality, theft, murder,"},{"p":5,"t":"adultery, greed, evil, deceit, debauchery, envy, slander, pride, and folly."},{"p":5,"t":"All these evils come from within and defile a person.”"},{"p":6,"t":"After Jesus left there, he went to the region of Tyre. When he went into a house, he did not want anyone to know, but he was not able to escape notice."},{"p":6,"t":"Instead, a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him and came and fell at his feet."},{"p":6,"t":"The woman was a Greek, of Syrophoenician origin. She asked him to cast the demon out of her daughter."},{"p":6,"t":"He said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and to throw it to the dogs.”"},{"p":6,"t":"She answered, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”"},{"p":6,"t":"Then he said to her, “Because you said this, you may go. The demon has left your daughter.”"},{"p":6,"t":"She went home and found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone."},{"p":7,"t":"Then Jesus went out again from the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee in the region of the Decapolis."},{"p":7,"t":"They brought to him a deaf man who had difficulty speaking, and they asked him to place his hands on him."},{"p":7,"t":"After Jesus took him aside privately, away from the crowd, he put his fingers in the man’s ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue."},{"p":7,"t":"Then he looked up to heaven and said with a sigh, “Ephphatha” (that is, “Be opened”)."},{"p":7,"t":"And immediately the man’s ears were opened, his tongue loosened, and he spoke plainly."},{"p":7,"t":"Jesus ordered them not to tell anything.

After he took the seven loaves and gave thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples to serve. So they served the crowd."},{"p":1,"t":"They also had a few small fish. After giving thanks for these, he told them to serve these as well."},{"p":1,"t":"Everyone ate and was satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full."},{"p":1,"t":"There were about four thousand who ate. Then he dismissed them."},{"p":1,"t":"Immediately he got into a boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha."},{"p":2,"t":"Then the Pharisees came and began to argue with Jesus, asking for a sign from heaven to test him."},{"p":2,"t":"Sighing deeply in his spirit he said, “Why does this generation look for a sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be given to this generation.”"},{"p":2,"t":"Then he left them, got back into the boat, and went to the other side."},{"p":3,"t":"Now they had forgotten to take bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat."},{"p":3,"t":"And Jesus ordered them, “Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod!”"},{"p":3,"t":"So they began to discuss with one another about having no bread."},{"p":3,"t":"When he learned of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you arguing about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Have your hearts been hardened?"},{"p":3,"t":"Though you have eyes, don’t you see? And though you have ears, can’t you hear? Don’t you remember?"},{"p":3,"t":"When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up?” They replied, “Twelve.”"},{"p":3,"t":"“When I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up?” They replied, “Seven.”"},{"p":3,"t":"Then he said to them, “Do you still not understand?”"},{"p":4,"t":"Then they came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to Jesus and asked him to touch him."},{"p":4,"t":"He took the blind man by the hand and brought him outside of the village. Then he spit on his eyes, placed his hands on his eyes and asked, “Do you see anything?”"},{"p":4,"t":"Regaining his sight he said, “I see people, but they look like trees walking.”"},{"p":4,"t":"Then Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes again. And he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly."},{"p":4,"t":"Jesus sent him home, saying, “Do not even go into the village.”"},{"p":5,"t":"Then Jesus and his disciples went to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?”"},{"p":5,"t":"They said, “John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others, one of the prophets.”"},{"p":5,"t":"He asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Christ.”"},{"p":5,"t":"Then he warned them not to tell anyone about him."},{"p":6,"t":"Then Jesus began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and experts in the law, and be killed, and after three days rise again."},{"p":6,"t":"He spoke openly about this. So Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him."},{"p":6,"t":"But after turning and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan. You are not setting your mind on God’s interests, but on man’s.”"},{"p":7,"t":"Then Jesus called the crowd, along with his disciples, and said to them, “If anyone wants to become my follower, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."},{"p":7,"t":"For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and for the gospel will save it."},{"p":7,"t":"For what benefit is it for a person to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his life?"},{"p":7,"t":"What can a person give in exchange for his life?"},{"p":7,"t":"For if anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"And he said to them, “I tell you the truth, there are some standing here who will not experience death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.”"},{"p":2,"t":"Six days later Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John and led them alone up a high mountain privately. And he was transfigured before them,"},{"p":2,"t":"and his clothes became radiantly white, more so than any launderer in the world could bleach them."},{"p":2,"t":"Then Elijah appeared before them along with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus."},{"p":2,"t":"So Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three shelters &#8211; one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”"},{"p":2,"t":"(For they were afraid, and he did not know what to say.)"},{"p":2,"t":"Then a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came from the cloud, “This is my one dear Son. Listen to him!”"},{"p":2,"t":"Suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one with them any more except Jesus."},{"p":3,"t":"As they were coming down from the mountain, he gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead."},{"p":3,"t":"They kept this statement to themselves, discussing what this rising from the dead meant."},{"p":4,"t":"Then they asked him, “Why do the experts in the law say that Elijah must come first?”"},{"p":4,"t":"He said to them, “Elijah does indeed come first, and restores all things. And why is it written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be despised?"},{"p":4,"t":"But I tell you that Elijah has certainly come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him.”"},{"p":5,"t":"When they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and experts in the law arguing with them."},{"p":5,"t":"When the whole crowd saw him, they were amazed and ran at once and greeted him."},{"p":5,"t":"He asked them, “What are you arguing about with them?”"},{"p":5,"t":"A member of the crowd said to him, “Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that makes him mute."},{"p":5,"t":"Whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to cast it out, but they were not able to do so.”"},{"p":5,"t":"He answered them, “You unbelieving generation! How much longer must I be with you? How much longer must I endure you? Bring him to me.”"},{"p":5,"t":"So they brought the boy to him. When the spirit saw him, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell on the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth."},{"p":5,"t":"Jesus asked his father, “How long has this been happening to him?” And he said, “From childhood."},{"p":5,"t":"It has often thrown him into fire or water to destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”"},{"p":5,"t":"Then Jesus said to him, “‘If you are able?’ All things are possible for the one who believes.”"},{"p":5,"t":"Immediately the father of the boy cried out and said, “I believe; help my unbelief!”"},{"p":6,"t":"Now when Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “Mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.”"},{"p":6,"t":"It shrieked, threw him into terrible convulsions, and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, “He is dead!”"},{"p":6,"t":"But Jesus gently took his hand and raised him to his feet, and he stood up."},{"p":7,"t":"Then, after he went into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?”"},{"p":7,"t":"He told them, “This kind can come out only by prayer.”"},{"p":8,"t":"They went out from there and passed through Galilee. But Jesus did not want anyone to know,"},{"p":8,"t":"for he was teaching his disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.”"},{"p":8,"t":"But they did not understand this statement and were afraid to ask him."},{"p":9,"t":"Then they came to Capernaum. After Jesus was inside the house he asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?”"},{"p":9,"t":"But they were silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest."},{"p":9,"t":"After he sat down, he called the twelve and said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.”"},{"p":9,"t":"He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,"},{"p":9,"t":"“Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.”"},{"p":10,"t":"John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because he was not following us.”"},{"p":10,"t":"But Jesus said, “Do not stop him, because no one who does a miracle in my name will be able soon afterward to say anything bad about me."},{"p":10,"t":"For whoever is not against us is for us."},{"p":10,"t":"For I tell you the truth, whoever gives you a cup of water because you bear Christ’s name will never lose his reward."},{"p":11,"t":"“If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a huge millstone tied around his neck and to be thrown into the sea."},{"p":11,"t":"If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off!

It is better to enter life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell."},{"p":11,"t":"[[EMPTY]]"},{"p":11,"t":"If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out!

Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with each other.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"Then Jesus left that place and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan River. Again crowds gathered to him, and again, as was his custom, he taught them."},{"p":1,"t":"Then some Pharisees came, and to test him they asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”"},{"p":1,"t":"He answered them, “What did Moses command you?”"},{"p":1,"t":"They said, “Moses permitted a man to write <b>a certificate of dismissal</b> and to divorce her.”"},{"p":1,"t":"But Jesus said to them, “He wrote this commandment for you because of your hard hearts."},{"p":1,"t":"But from the beginning of creation <b>he</b> <b>made them male and female</b>."},{"p":1,"t":"<b>For this reason a man will leave his father and mother,</b>"},{"p":1,"t":"<b>and the two will become one flesh</b>.

No one is good except God alone."},{"p":4,"t":"You know the commandments: ‘<b>Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony,</b> do not defraud<b>, honor your father and mother</b>.’”"},{"p":4,"t":"The man said to him, “Teacher, I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws since my youth.”"},{"p":4,"t":"As Jesus looked at him, he felt love for him and said, “You lack one thing. Go, sell whatever you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”"},{"p":4,"t":"But at this statement, the man looked sad and went away sorrowful, for he was very rich."},{"p":5,"t":"Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!”"},{"p":5,"t":"The disciples were astonished at these words. But again Jesus said to them, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!"},{"p":5,"t":"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”"},{"p":5,"t":"They were even more astonished and said to one another, “Then who can be saved?”"},{"p":5,"t":"Jesus looked at them and replied, “This is impossible for mere humans, but not for God; all things are possible for God.”"},{"p":6,"t":"Peter began to speak to him, “Look, we have left everything to follow you!”"},{"p":6,"t":"Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, there is no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the gospel"},{"p":6,"t":"who will not receive in this age a hundred times as much &#8211; homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, fields, all with persecutions &#8211; and in the age to come, eternal life."},{"p":6,"t":"But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”"},{"p":7,"t":"They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem.

He took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what was going to happen to him."},{"p":7,"t":"“Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and experts in the law. They will condemn him to death and will turn him over to the Gentiles."},{"p":7,"t":"They will mock him, spit on him, flog him severely, and kill him. Yet after three days, he will rise again.”"},{"p":8,"t":"Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him and said, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.”"},{"p":8,"t":"He said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”"},{"p":8,"t":"They said to him, “Permit one of us to sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your glory.”"},{"p":8,"t":"But Jesus said to them, “You don’t know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I experience?”"},{"p":8,"t":"They said to him, “We are able.” Then Jesus said to them, “You will drink the cup I drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism I experience,"},{"p":8,"t":"but to sit at my right or at my left is not mine to give. It is for those for whom it has been prepared.”"},{"p":9,"t":"Now when the other ten heard this, they became angry with James and John."},{"p":9,"t":"Jesus called them and said to them, “You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in high positions use their authority over them."},{"p":9,"t":"But it is not this way among you. Instead whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant,"},{"p":9,"t":"and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of all."},{"p":9,"t":"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”"},{"p":10,"t":"They came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road."},{"p":10,"t":"When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”"},{"p":10,"t":"Many scolded him to get him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”"},{"p":10,"t":"Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” So they called the blind man and said to him, “Have courage!
