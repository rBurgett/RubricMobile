When the young woman goes out to draw water, I’ll say, “Give me a little water to drink from your jug.”"},{"p":11,"t":"Then she will reply to me, “Drink, and I’ll draw water for your camels too.” May that woman be the one whom the Lord has chosen for my master’s son.’"},{"p":12,"t":"“Before I finished praying in my heart, along came Rebekah with her water jug on her shoulder! She went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’"},{"p":12,"t":"She quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I’ll give your camels water too.’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels water."},{"p":12,"t":"Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She replied, ‘The daughter of Bethuel the son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to Nahor.’ I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her wrists."},{"p":12,"t":"Then I bowed down and worshiped the Lord. I praised the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right path to find the granddaughter of my master’s brother for his son."},{"p":12,"t":"Now, if you will show faithful love to my master, tell me. But if not, tell me as well, so that I may go on my way.”"},{"p":13,"t":"Then Laban and Bethuel replied, “This is the Lord’s doing. Our wishes are of no concern."},{"p":13,"t":"Rebekah stands here before you. Take her and go so that she may become the wife of your master’s son, just as the Lord has decided.”"},{"p":14,"t":"When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed down to the ground before the Lord."},{"p":14,"t":"Then he brought out gold, silver jewelry, and clothing and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave valuable gifts to her brother and to her mother."},{"p":14,"t":"After this, he and the men who were with him ate a meal and stayed there overnight. When they got up in the morning, he said, “Let me leave now so I can return to my master.”"},{"p":15,"t":"But Rebekah’s brother and her mother replied, “Let the girl stay with us a few more days, perhaps ten. Then she can go.”"},{"p":15,"t":"But he said to them, “Don’t detain me &#8211; the Lord has granted me success on my journey. Let me leave now so I may return to my master.”"},{"p":15,"t":"Then they said, “We’ll call the girl and find out what she wants to do.”"},{"p":15,"t":"So they called Rebekah and asked her, “Do you want to go with this man?” She replied, “I want to go.”"},{"p":16,"t":"So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, accompanied by her female attendant, with Abraham’s servant and his men."},{"p":16,"t":"They blessed Rebekah with these words: “Our sister, may you become the mother of thousands of ten thousands! May your descendants possess the strongholds of their enemies.”"},{"p":17,"t":"Then Rebekah and her female servants mounted the camels and rode away with the man. So Abraham’s servant took Rebekah and left."},{"p":18,"t":"Now Isaac came from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev."},{"p":18,"t":"He went out to relax in the field in the early evening. Then he looked up and saw that there were camels approaching."},{"p":18,"t":"Rebekah looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel"},{"p":18,"t":"and asked Abraham’s servant, “Who is that man walking in the field toward us?” “That is my master,” the servant replied. So she took her veil and covered herself."},{"p":19,"t":"The servant told Isaac everything that had happened."},{"p":19,"t":"Then Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother Sarah’s tent. He took her as his wife and loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death."}],[{"p":1,"t":"Abraham had taken another wife, named Keturah."},{"p":1,"t":"She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah."},{"p":1,"t":"Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. The descendants of Dedan were the Asshurites, Letushites, and Leummites."},{"p":1,"t":"The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah."},{"p":2,"t":"Everything he owned Abraham left to his son Isaac."},{"p":2,"t":"But while he was still alive, Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them off to the east, away from his son Isaac."},{"p":3,"t":"Abraham lived a total of 175 years."},{"p":3,"t":"Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man who had lived a full life. He joined his ancestors."},{"p":3,"t":"His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar, the Hethite."},{"p":3,"t":"This was the field Abraham had purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah."},{"p":3,"t":"After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac. Isaac lived near Beer Lahai Roi."},{"p":4,"t":"This is the account of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s servant, bore to Abraham."},{"p":5,"t":"These are the names of Ishmael’s sons, by their names according to their records: Nebaioth (Ishmael’s firstborn), Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,"},{"p":5,"t":"Mishma, Dumah, Massa,"},{"p":5,"t":"Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah."},{"p":5,"t":"These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their settlements and their camps &#8211; twelve princes according to their clans."},{"p":6,"t":"Ishmael lived a total of 137 years. He breathed his last and died; then he joined his ancestors."},{"p":6,"t":"His descendants settled from Havilah to Shur, which runs next to Egypt all the way to Asshur. They settled away from all their relatives."},{"p":7,"t":"This is the account of Isaac, the son of Abraham. Abraham became the father of Isaac."},{"p":8,"t":"When Isaac was forty years old, he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean."},{"p":9,"t":"Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife because she was childless. The Lord answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant."},{"p":9,"t":"But the children struggled inside her, and she said, “If it is going to be like this, I’m not so sure I want to be pregnant!” So she asked the Lord,"},{"p":9,"t":"and the Lord said to her, “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples will be separated from within you. One people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.”"},{"p":10,"t":"When the time came for Rebekah to give birth, there were twins in her womb."},{"p":10,"t":"The first came out reddish all over, like a hairy garment, so they named him Esau."},{"p":10,"t":"When his brother came out with his hand clutching Esau’s heel, they named him Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born."},{"p":11,"t":"When the boys grew up, Esau became a skilled hunter, a man of the open fields, but Jacob was an even-tempered man, living in tents."},{"p":11,"t":"Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for fresh game, but Rebekah loved Jacob."},{"p":12,"t":"Now Jacob cooked some stew, and when Esau came in from the open fields, he was famished."},{"p":12,"t":"So Esau said to Jacob, “Feed me some of the red stuff &#8211; yes, this red stuff &#8211; because I’m starving!” (That is why he was also called Edom.)"},{"p":13,"t":"But Jacob replied, “First sell me your birthright.”"},{"p":13,"t":"“Look,” said Esau, “I’m about to die! What use is the birthright to me?”"},{"p":13,"t":"But Jacob said, “Swear an oath to me now.” So Esau swore an oath to him and sold his birthright to Jacob."},{"p":14,"t":"Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and lentil stew; Esau ate and drank, then got up and went out. So Esau despised his birthright."}],[{"p":1,"t":"There was a famine in the land, subsequent to the earlier famine that occurred in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar."},{"p":1,"t":"The Lord appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; settle down in the land that I will point out to you."},{"p":1,"t":"Stay in this land. Then I will be with you and will bless you, for I will give all these lands to you and to your descendants, and I will fulfill the solemn promise I made to your father Abraham."},{"p":1,"t":"I will multiply your descendants so they will be as numerous as the stars in the sky, and I will give them all these lands. All the nations of the earth will pronounce blessings on one another using the name of your descendants."},{"p":1,"t":"All this will come to pass because Abraham obeyed me and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”"},{"p":1,"t":"So Isaac settled in Gerar."},{"p":2,"t":"When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he replied, “She is my sister.” He was afraid to say, “She is my wife,” for he thought to himself, “The men of this place will kill me to get Rebekah because she is very beautiful.”"},{"p":3,"t":"After Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines happened to look out a window and observed Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah."},{"p":3,"t":"So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, “She is really your wife! Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac replied, “Because I thought someone might kill me to get her.”"},{"p":4,"t":"Then Abimelech exclaimed, “What in the world have you done to us? One of the men might easily have had sexual relations with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!”"},{"p":4,"t":"So Abimelech commanded all the people, “Whoever touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.”"},{"p":5,"t":"When Isaac planted in that land, he reaped in the same year a hundred times what he had sown, because the Lord blessed him."},{"p":5,"t":"The man became wealthy. His influence continued to grow until he became very prominent."},{"p":5,"t":"He had so many sheep and cattle and such a great household of servants that the Philistines became jealous of him."},{"p":5,"t":"So the Philistines took dirt and filled up all the wells that his father’s servants had dug back in the days of his father Abraham."},{"p":6,"t":"Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “Leave us and go elsewhere, for you have become much more powerful than we are.”"},{"p":6,"t":"So Isaac left there and settled in the Gerar Valley."},{"p":6,"t":"Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug back in the days of his father Abraham, for the Philistines had stopped them up after Abraham died. Isaac gave these wells the same names his father had given them."},{"p":7,"t":"When Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well with fresh flowing water there,"},{"p":7,"t":"the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water belongs to us!” So Isaac named the well Esek because they argued with him about it."},{"p":7,"t":"His servants dug another well, but they quarreled over it too, so Isaac named it Sitnah."},{"p":7,"t":"Then he moved away from there and dug another well. They did not quarrel over it, so Isaac named it Rehoboth, saying, “For now the Lord has made room for us, and we will prosper in the land.”"},{"p":8,"t":"From there Isaac went up to Beer Sheba."},{"p":8,"t":"The Lord appeared to him that night and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham.”"},{"p":8,"t":"Then Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the Lord. He pitched his tent there, and his servants dug a well."},{"p":9,"t":"Now Abimelech had come to him from Gerar along with Ahuzzah his friend and Phicol the commander of his army."},{"p":9,"t":"Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me? You hate me and sent me away from you.”"},{"p":9,"t":"They replied, “We could plainly see that the Lord is with you. So we decided there should be a pact between us &#8211; between us and you. Allow us to make a treaty with you"},{"p":9,"t":"so that you will not do us any harm, just as we have not harmed you, but have always treated you well before sending you away in peace. Now you are blessed by the Lord.”"},{"p":10,"t":"So Isaac held a feast for them and they celebrated."},{"p":10,"t":"Early in the morning the men made a treaty with each other. Isaac sent them off; they separated on good terms."},{"p":11,"t":"That day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. “We’ve found water,” they reported."},{"p":11,"t":"So he named it Shibah; that is why the name of the city has been Beer Sheba to this day."},{"p":12,"t":"When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, as well as Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite."},{"p":12,"t":"They caused Isaac and Rebekah great anxiety."}],[{"p":1,"t":"When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he was almost blind, he called his older son Esau and said to him, “My son!” “Here I am!” Esau replied."},{"p":1,"t":"Isaac said, “Since I am so old, I could die at any time."},{"p":1,"t":"Therefore, take your weapons &#8211; your quiver and your bow &#8211; and go out into the open fields and hunt down some wild game for me."},{"p":1,"t":"Then prepare for me some tasty food, the kind I love, and bring it to me. Then I will eat it so that I may bless you before I die.”"},{"p":2,"t":"Now Rebekah had been listening while Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau went out to the open fields to hunt down some wild game and bring it back,"},{"p":2,"t":"Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Look, I overheard your father tell your brother Esau,"},{"p":2,"t":"‘Bring me some wild game and prepare for me some tasty food. Then I will eat it and bless you in the presence of the Lord before I die.’"},{"p":2,"t":"Now then, my son, do exactly what I tell you!"},{"p":2,"t":"Go to the flock and get me two of the best young goats. I’ll prepare them in a tasty way for your father, just the way he loves them."},{"p":2,"t":"Then you will take it to your father. Thus he will eat it and bless you before he dies.”"},{"p":3,"t":"“But Esau my brother is a hairy man,” Jacob protested to his mother Rebekah, “and I have smooth skin!"},{"p":3,"t":"My father may touch me! Then he’ll think I’m mocking him and I’ll bring a curse on myself instead of a blessing.”"},{"p":3,"t":"So his mother told him, “Any curse against you will fall on me, my son! Just obey me! Go and get them for me!”"},{"p":4,"t":"So he went and got the goats and brought them to his mother. She prepared some tasty food, just the way his father loved it."},{"p":4,"t":"Then Rebekah took her older son Esau’s best clothes, which she had with her in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob."},{"p":4,"t":"She put the skins of the young goats on his hands and the smooth part of his neck."},{"p":4,"t":"Then she handed the tasty food and the bread she had made to her son Jacob."},{"p":5,"t":"He went to his father and said, “My father!” Isaac replied, “Here I am. Which are you, my son?”"},{"p":5,"t":"Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau, your firstborn. I’ve done as you told me. Now sit up and eat some of my wild game so that you can bless me.”"},{"p":5,"t":"But Isaac asked his son, “How in the world did you find it so quickly, my son?” “Because the Lord your God brought it to me,” he replied."},{"p":5,"t":"Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come closer so I can touch you, my son, and know for certain if you really are my son Esau.”"},{"p":5,"t":"So Jacob went over to his father Isaac, who felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob’s, but the hands are Esau’s.”"},{"p":5,"t":"He did not recognize him because his hands were hairy, like his brother Esau’s hands. So Isaac blessed Jacob."},{"p":5,"t":"Then he asked, “Are you really my son Esau?” “I am,” Jacob replied."},{"p":5,"t":"Isaac said, “Bring some of the wild game for me to eat, my son. Then I will bless you.” So Jacob brought it to him, and he ate it. He also brought him wine, and Isaac drank."},{"p":5,"t":"Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come here and kiss me, my son.”"},{"p":5,"t":"So Jacob went over and kissed him. When Isaac caught the scent of his clothing, he blessed him, saying, “Yes, my son smells like the scent of an open field which the Lord has blessed."},{"p":6,"t":"May God give you the dew of the sky and the richness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine."},{"p":7,"t":"May peoples serve you and nations bow down to you. You will be lord over your brothers, and the sons of your mother will bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed, and those who bless you be blessed.”"},{"p":8,"t":"Isaac had just finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely left his father’s presence, when his brother Esau returned from the hunt."},{"p":8,"t":"He also prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Esau said to him, “My father, get up and eat some of your son’s wild game. Then you can bless me.”"},{"p":8,"t":"His father Isaac asked, “Who are you?” “I am your firstborn son,” he replied, “Esau!”"},{"p":8,"t":"Isaac began to shake violently and asked, “Then who else hunted game and brought it to me? I ate all of it just before you arrived, and I blessed him. He will indeed be blessed!”"},{"p":9,"t":"When Esau heard his father’s words, he wailed loudly and bitterly. He said to his father, “Bless me too, my father!”"},{"p":9,"t":"But Isaac replied, “Your brother came in here deceitfully and took away your blessing.”"},{"p":9,"t":"Esau exclaimed, “‘Jacob’ is the right name for him! He has tripped me up two times! He took away my birthright, and now, look, he has taken away my blessing!” Then he asked, “Have you not kept back a blessing for me?”"},{"p":10,"t":"Isaac replied to Esau, “Look! I have made him lord over you. I have made all his relatives his servants and provided him with grain and new wine. What is left that I can do for you, my son?”"},{"p":10,"t":"Esau said to his father, “Do you have only that one blessing, my father? Bless me too!” Then Esau wept loudly."},{"p":11,"t":"So his father Isaac said to him, “Indeed, your home will be away from the richness of the earth, and away from the dew of the sky above."},{"p":12,"t":"You will live by your sword but you will serve your brother. When you grow restless, you will tear off his yoke from your neck.”"},{"p":13,"t":"So Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing his father had given to his brother. Esau said privately, “The time of mourning for my father is near; then I will kill my brother Jacob!”"},{"p":14,"t":"When Rebekah heard what her older son Esau had said, she quickly summoned her younger son Jacob and told him, “Look, your brother Esau is planning to get revenge by killing you."},{"p":14,"t":"Now then, my son, do what I say. Run away immediately to my brother Laban in Haran."},{"p":14,"t":"Live with him for a little while until your brother’s rage subsides."},{"p":14,"t":"Stay there until your brother’s anger against you subsides and he forgets what you did to him. Then I’ll send someone to bring you back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”"},{"p":15,"t":"Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am deeply depressed because of these daughters of Heth. If Jacob were to marry one of these daughters of Heth who live in this land, I would want to die!”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. Then he commanded him, “You must not marry a Canaanite woman!"},{"p":1,"t":"Leave immediately for Paddan Aram! Go to the house of Bethuel, your mother’s father, and find yourself a wife there, among the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother."},{"p":1,"t":"May the sovereign God bless you! May he make you fruitful and give you a multitude of descendants! Then you will become a large nation."},{"p":1,"t":"May he give you and your descendants the blessing he gave to Abraham so that you may possess the land God gave to Abraham, the land where you have been living as a temporary resident.”"},{"p":1,"t":"So Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean and brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau."},{"p":2,"t":"Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him off to Paddan Aram to find a wife there. As he blessed him, Isaac commanded him, “You must not marry a Canaanite woman.”"},{"p":2,"t":"Jacob obeyed his father and mother and left for Paddan Aram."},{"p":2,"t":"Then Esau realized that the Canaanite women were displeasing to his father Isaac."},{"p":2,"t":"So Esau went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Abraham’s son Ishmael, along with the wives he already had."},{"p":3,"t":"Meanwhile Jacob left Beer Sheba and set out for Haran."},{"p":3,"t":"He reached a certain place where he decided to camp because the sun had gone down. He took one of the stones and placed it near his head. Then he fell asleep in that place"},{"p":3,"t":"and had a dream. He saw a stairway erected on the earth with its top reaching to the heavens. The angels of God were going up and coming down it"},{"p":3,"t":"and the Lord stood at its top. He said, “I am the Lord, the God of your grandfather Abraham and the God of your father Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the ground you are lying on."},{"p":3,"t":"Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west, east, north, and south. All the families of the earth will pronounce blessings on one another using your name and that of your descendants."},{"p":3,"t":"I am with you! I will protect you wherever you go and will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I promised you!”"},{"p":4,"t":"Then Jacob woke up and thought, “Surely the Lord is in this place, but I did not realize it!”"},{"p":4,"t":"He was afraid and said, “What an awesome place this is! This is nothing else than the house of God! This is the gate of heaven!”"},{"p":5,"t":"Early in the morning Jacob took the stone he had placed near his head and set it up as a sacred stone. Then he poured oil on top of it."},{"p":5,"t":"He called that place Bethel, although the former name of the town was Luz."},{"p":5,"t":"Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God is with me and protects me on this journey I am taking and gives me food to eat and clothing to wear,"},{"p":5,"t":"and I return safely to my father’s home, then the Lord will become my God."},{"p":5,"t":"Then this stone that I have set up as a sacred stone will be the house of God, and I will surely give you back a tenth of everything you give me.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"So Jacob moved on and came to the land of the eastern people."},{"p":1,"t":"He saw in the field a well with three flocks of sheep lying beside it, because the flocks were watered from that well. Now a large stone covered the mouth of the well."},{"p":1,"t":"When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone off the mouth of the well and water the sheep. Then they would put the stone back in its place over the well’s mouth."},{"p":2,"t":"Jacob asked them, “My brothers, where are you from?” They replied, “We’re from Haran.”"},{"p":2,"t":"So he said to them, “Do you know Laban, the grandson of Nahor?” “We know him,” they said."},{"p":2,"t":"“Is he well?” Jacob asked. They replied, “He is well. Now look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.”"},{"p":2,"t":"Then Jacob said, “Since it is still the middle of the day, it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. You should water the sheep and then go and let them graze some more.”"},{"p":2,"t":"“We can’t,” they said, “until all the flocks are gathered and the stone is rolled off the mouth of the well. Then we water the sheep.”"},{"p":3,"t":"While he was still speaking with them, Rachel arrived with her father’s sheep, for she was tending them."},{"p":3,"t":"When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his uncle Laban, and the sheep of his uncle Laban, he went over and rolled the stone off the mouth of the well and watered the sheep of his uncle Laban."},{"p":3,"t":"Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep loudly."},{"p":3,"t":"When Jacob explained to Rachel that he was a relative of her father and the son of Rebekah, she ran and told her father."},{"p":3,"t":"When Laban heard this news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he rushed out to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban how he was related to him."},{"p":3,"t":"Then Laban said to him, “You are indeed my own flesh and blood.” So Jacob stayed with him for a month."},{"p":4,"t":"Then Laban said to Jacob, “Should you work for me for nothing because you are my relative? Tell me what your wages should be.”"},{"p":4,"t":"(Now Laban had two daughters; the older one was named Leah, and the younger one Rachel."},{"p":4,"t":"Leah’s eyes were tender, but Rachel had a lovely figure and beautiful appearance.)"},{"p":4,"t":"Since Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel, he said, “I’ll serve you seven years in exchange for your younger daughter Rachel.”"},{"p":4,"t":"Laban replied, “I’d rather give her to you than to another man. Stay with me.”"},{"p":4,"t":"So Jacob worked for seven years to acquire Rachel. But they seemed like only a few days to him because his love for her was so great."},{"p":5,"t":"Finally Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my time of service is up. I want to have marital relations with her.”"},{"p":5,"t":"So Laban invited all the people of that place and prepared a feast."},{"p":5,"t":"In the evening he brought his daughter Leah to Jacob, and Jacob had marital relations with her."},{"p":5,"t":"(Laban gave his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant.)"},{"p":6,"t":"In the morning Jacob discovered it was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, “What in the world have you done to me! Didn’t I work for you in exchange for Rachel? Why have you tricked me?”"},{"p":6,"t":"“It is not our custom here,” Laban replied, “to give the younger daughter in marriage before the firstborn."},{"p":6,"t":"Complete my older daughter’s bridal week. Then we will give you the younger one too, in exchange for seven more years of work.”"},{"p":7,"t":"Jacob did as Laban said. When Jacob completed Leah’s bridal week, Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife."},{"p":7,"t":"(Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.)"},{"p":7,"t":"Jacob had marital relations with Rachel as well. He loved Rachel more than Leah, so he worked for Laban for seven more years."},{"p":8,"t":"When the Lord saw that Leah was unloved, he enabled her to become pregnant while Rachel remained childless."},{"p":8,"t":"So Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, “The Lord has looked with pity on my oppressed condition. Surely my husband will love me now.”"},{"p":9,"t":"She became pregnant again and had another son. She said, “Because the Lord heard that I was unloved, he gave me this one too.” So she named him Simeon."},{"p":10,"t":"She became pregnant again and had another son. She said, “Now this time my husband will show me affection, because I have given birth to three sons for him.” That is why he was named Levi."},{"p":11,"t":"She became pregnant again and had another son. She said, “This time I will praise the Lord.” That is why she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children."}],[{"p":1,"t":"When Rachel saw that she could not give Jacob children, she became jealous of her sister. She said to Jacob, “Give me children or I’ll die!”"},{"p":1,"t":"Jacob became furious with Rachel and exclaimed, “Am I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?”"},{"p":1,"t":"She replied, “Here is my servant Bilhah! Have sexual relations with her so that she can bear children for me and I can have a family through her.”"},{"p":2,"t":"So Rachel gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob had marital relations with her."},{"p":2,"t":"Bilhah became pregnant and gave Jacob a son."},{"p":2,"t":"Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me. He has responded to my prayer and given me a son.” That is why she named him Dan."},{"p":3,"t":"Bilhah, Rachel’s servant, became pregnant again and gave Jacob another son."},{"p":3,"t":"Then Rachel said, “I have fought a desperate struggle with my sister, but I have won.” So she named him Naphtali."},{"p":4,"t":"When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she gave her servant Zilpah to Jacob as a wife."},{"p":4,"t":"Soon Leah’s servant Zilpah gave Jacob a son."},{"p":4,"t":"Leah said, “How fortunate!” So she named him Gad."},{"p":5,"t":"Then Leah’s servant Zilpah gave Jacob another son."},{"p":5,"t":"Leah said, “How happy I am, for women will call me happy!” So she named him Asher."},{"p":6,"t":"At the time of the wheat harvest Reuben went out and found some mandrake plants in a field and brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, “Give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”"},{"p":6,"t":"But Leah replied, “Wasn’t it enough that you’ve taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes too?” “All right,” Rachel said, “he may sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.”"},{"p":6,"t":"When Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must sleep with me because I have paid for your services with my son’s mandrakes.” So he had marital relations with her that night."},{"p":6,"t":"God paid attention to Leah; she became pregnant and gave Jacob a son for the fifth time."},{"p":6,"t":"Then Leah said, “God has granted me a reward because I gave my servant to my husband as a wife.” So she named him Issachar."},{"p":7,"t":"Leah became pregnant again and gave Jacob a son for the sixth time."},{"p":7,"t":"Then Leah said, “God has given me a good gift. Now my husband will honor me because I have given him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun."},{"p":8,"t":"After that she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah."},{"p":9,"t":"Then God took note of Rachel. He paid attention to her and enabled her to become pregnant."},{"p":9,"t":"She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. Then she said, “God has taken away my shame.”"},{"p":9,"t":"She named him Joseph, saying, “May the Lord give me yet another son.”"},{"p":10,"t":"After Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way so that I can go home to my own country."},{"p":10,"t":"Let me take my wives and my children whom I have acquired by working for you. Then I’ll depart, because you know how hard I’ve worked for you.”"},{"p":11,"t":"But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your sight, please stay here, for I have learned by divination that the Lord has blessed me on account of you.”"},{"p":11,"t":"He added, “Just name your wages &#8211; I’ll pay whatever you want.”"},{"p":12,"t":"“You know how I have worked for you,” Jacob replied, “and how well your livestock have fared under my care."},{"p":12,"t":"Indeed, you had little before I arrived, but now your possessions have increased many times over. The Lord has blessed you wherever I worked. But now, how long must it be before I do something for my own family too?”"},{"p":13,"t":"So Laban asked, “What should I give you?” “You don’t need to give me a thing,” Jacob replied, “but if you agree to this one condition, I will continue to care for your flocks and protect them:"},{"p":13,"t":"Let me walk among all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb, and the spotted or speckled goats. These animals will be my wages."},{"p":13,"t":"My integrity will testify for me later on. When you come to verify that I’ve taken only the wages we agreed on, if I have in my possession any goat that is not speckled or spotted or any sheep that is not dark-colored, it will be considered stolen.”"},{"p":13,"t":"“Agreed!” said Laban, “It will be as you say.”"},{"p":14,"t":"So that day Laban removed the male goats that were streaked or spotted, all the female goats that were speckled or spotted (all that had any white on them), and all the dark-colored lambs, and put them in the care of his sons."},{"p":14,"t":"Then he separated them from Jacob by a three-day journey, while Jacob was taking care of the rest of Laban’s flocks."},{"p":15,"t":"But Jacob took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond, and plane trees. He made white streaks by peeling them, making the white inner wood in the branches visible."},{"p":15,"t":"Then he set up the peeled branches in all the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink. He set up the branches in front of the flocks when they were in heat and came to drink."},{"p":15,"t":"When the sheep mated in front of the branches, they gave birth to young that were streaked or speckled or spotted."},{"p":15,"t":"Jacob removed these lambs, but he made the rest of the flock face the streaked and completely dark-colored animals in Laban’s flock. So he made separate flocks for himself and did not mix them with Laban’s flocks."},{"p":15,"t":"When the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would set up the branches in the troughs in front of the flock, so they would mate near the branches."},{"p":15,"t":"But if the animals were weaker, he did not set the branches there. So the weaker animals ended up belonging to Laban and the stronger animals to Jacob."},{"p":15,"t":"In this way Jacob became extremely prosperous. He owned large flocks, male and female servants, camels, and donkeys."}],[{"p":1,"t":"Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were complaining, “Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father! He has gotten rich at our father’s expense!”"},{"p":1,"t":"When Jacob saw the look on Laban’s face, he could tell his attitude toward him had changed."},{"p":2,"t":"The Lord said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives. I will be with you.”"},{"p":2,"t":"So Jacob sent a message for Rachel and Leah to come to the field where his flocks were."},{"p":2,"t":"There he said to them, “I can tell that your father’s attitude toward me has changed, but the God of my father has been with me."},{"p":2,"t":"You know that I’ve worked for your father as hard as I could,"},{"p":2,"t":"but your father has humiliated me and changed my wages ten times. But God has not permitted him to do me any harm."},{"p":2,"t":"If he said, ‘The speckled animals will be your wage,’ then the entire flock gave birth to speckled offspring. But if he said, ‘The streaked animals will be your wage,’ then the entire flock gave birth to streaked offspring."},{"p":2,"t":"In this way God has snatched away your father’s livestock and given them to me."},{"p":3,"t":"“Once during breeding season I saw in a dream that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled, and spotted."},{"p":3,"t":"In the dream the angel of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ ‘Here I am!’ I replied."},{"p":3,"t":"Then he said, ‘Observe that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled, or spotted, for I have observed all that Laban has done to you."},{"p":3,"t":"I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the sacred stone and made a vow to me. Now leave this land immediately and return to your native land.’”"},{"p":4,"t":"Then Rachel and Leah replied to him, “Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father’s house?"},{"p":4,"t":"Hasn’t he treated us like foreigners? He not only sold us, but completely wasted the money paid for us!"},{"p":4,"t":"Surely all the wealth that God snatched away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So now do everything God has told you.”"},{"p":5,"t":"So Jacob immediately put his children and his wives on the camels."},{"p":5,"t":"He took away all the livestock he had acquired in Paddan Aram and all his moveable property that he had accumulated. Then he set out toward the land of Canaan to return to his father Isaac."},{"p":6,"t":"While Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole the household idols that belonged to her father."},{"p":6,"t":"Jacob also deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was leaving."},{"p":6,"t":"He left with all he owned. He quickly crossed the Euphrates River and headed for the hill country of Gilead."},{"p":7,"t":"Three days later Laban discovered Jacob had left."},{"p":7,"t":"So he took his relatives with him and pursued Jacob for seven days. He caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead."},{"p":7,"t":"But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and warned him, “Be careful that you neither bless nor curse Jacob.”"},{"p":8,"t":"Laban overtook Jacob, and when Jacob pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead, Laban and his relatives set up camp there too."},{"p":8,"t":"“What have you done?” Laban demanded of Jacob. “You’ve deceived me and carried away my daughters as if they were captives of war!"},{"p":8,"t":"Why did you run away secretly and deceive me? Why didn’t you tell me so I could send you off with a celebration complete with singing, tambourines, and harps?"},{"p":8,"t":"You didn’t even allow me to kiss my daughters and my grandchildren good-bye. You have acted foolishly!"},{"p":8,"t":"I have the power to do you harm, but the God of your father told me last night, ‘Be careful that you neither bless nor curse Jacob.’"},{"p":8,"t":"Now I understand that you have gone away because you longed desperately for your father’s house. Yet why did you steal my gods?”"},{"p":9,"t":"“I left secretly because I was afraid!” Jacob replied to Laban. “I thought you might take your daughters away from me by force."},{"p":9,"t":"Whoever has taken your gods will be put to death! In the presence of our relatives identify whatever is yours and take it.” (Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.)"},{"p":10,"t":"So Laban entered Jacob’s tent, and Leah’s tent, and the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find the idols. Then he left Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s."},{"p":10,"t":"(Now Rachel had taken the idols and put them inside her camel’s saddle and sat on them.) Laban searched the whole tent, but did not find them."},{"p":10,"t":"Rachel said to her father, “Don’t be angry, my lord. I cannot stand up in your presence because I am having my period.” So he searched thoroughly, but did not find the idols."},{"p":11,"t":"Jacob became angry and argued with Laban. “What did I do wrong?” he demanded of Laban. “What sin of mine prompted you to chase after me in hot pursuit?"},{"p":11,"t":"When you searched through all my goods, did you find anything that belonged to you? Set it here before my relatives and yours, and let them settle the dispute between the two of us!"},{"p":12,"t":"“I have been with you for the past twenty years. Your ewes and female goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks."},{"p":12,"t":"Animals torn by wild beasts I never brought to you; I always absorbed the loss myself. You always made me pay for every missing animal, whether it was taken by day or at night."},{"p":12,"t":"I was consumed by scorching heat during the day and by piercing cold at night, and I went without sleep."},{"p":12,"t":"This was my lot for twenty years in your house: I worked like a slave for you &#8211; fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, but you changed my wages ten times!"},{"p":12,"t":"If the God of my father &#8211; the God of Abraham, the one whom Isaac fears &#8211; had not been with me, you would certainly have sent me away empty-handed! But God saw how I was oppressed and how hard I worked, and he rebuked you last night.”"},{"p":13,"t":"Laban replied to Jacob, “These women are my daughters, these children are my grandchildren, and these flocks are my flocks. All that you see belongs to me. But how can I harm these daughters of mine today or the children to whom they have given birth?"},{"p":13,"t":"So now, come, let’s make a formal agreement, you and I, and it will be proof that we have made peace.”"},{"p":14,"t":"So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a memorial pillar."},{"p":14,"t":"Then he said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” So they brought stones and put them in a pile. They ate there by the pile of stones."},{"p":14,"t":"Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed."},{"p":15,"t":"Laban said, “This pile of stones is a witness of our agreement today.” That is why it was called Galeed."},{"p":15,"t":"It was also called Mizpah because he said, “May the Lord watch between us when we are out of sight of one another."},{"p":15,"t":"If you mistreat my daughters or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one else is with us, realize that God is witness to your actions.”"},{"p":16,"t":"“Here is this pile of stones and this pillar I have set up between me and you,” Laban said to Jacob."},{"p":16,"t":"“This pile of stones and the pillar are reminders that I will not pass beyond this pile to come to harm you and that you will not pass beyond this pile and this pillar to come to harm me."},{"p":16,"t":"May the God of Abraham and the god of Nahor, the gods of their father, judge between us.” Jacob took an oath by the God whom his father Isaac feared."},{"p":16,"t":"Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his relatives to eat the meal. They ate the meal and spent the night on the mountain."},{"p":17,"t":" Early in the morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters goodbye and blessed them. Then Laban left and returned home."}],[{"p":1,"t":"So Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him."},{"p":1,"t":"When Jacob saw them, he exclaimed, “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Mahanaim."},{"p":2,"t":"Jacob sent messengers on ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the region of Edom."},{"p":2,"t":"He commanded them, “This is what you must say to my lord Esau: ‘This is what your servant Jacob says: I have been staying with Laban until now."},{"p":2,"t":"I have oxen, donkeys, sheep, and male and female servants. I have sent this message to inform my lord, so that I may find favor in your sight.’”"},{"p":3,"t":"The messengers returned to Jacob and said, “We went to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you and has four hundred men with him.”"},{"p":3,"t":"Jacob was very afraid and upset. So he divided the people who were with him into two camps, as well as the flocks, herds, and camels."},{"p":3,"t":"“If Esau attacks one camp,” he thought, “then the other camp will be able to escape.”"},{"p":4,"t":"Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O Lord, you said to me, ‘Return to your land and to your relatives and I will make you prosper.’"},{"p":4,"t":"I am not worthy of all the faithful love you have shown your servant. With only my walking stick I crossed the Jordan, but now I have become two camps."},{"p":4,"t":"Rescue me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, as well as the mothers with their children."},{"p":4,"t":"But you said, ‘I will certainly make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand on the seashore, too numerous to count.’”"},{"p":5,"t":"Jacob stayed there that night. Then he sent as a gift to his brother Esau"},{"p":5,"t":"two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,"},{"p":5,"t":"thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys."},{"p":5,"t":"He entrusted them to his servants, who divided them into herds. He told his servants, “Pass over before me, and keep some distance between one herd and the next.”"},{"p":5,"t":"He instructed the servant leading the first herd, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘To whom do you belong? Where are you going? Whose herds are you driving?’"},{"p":5,"t":"then you must say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They have been sent as a gift to my lord Esau. In fact Jacob himself is behind us.’”"},{"p":6,"t":"He also gave these instructions to the second and third servants, as well as all those who were following the herds, saying, “You must say the same thing to Esau when you meet him."},{"p":6,"t":"You must also say, ‘In fact your servant Jacob is behind us.’” Jacob thought, “I will first appease him by sending a gift ahead of me. After that I will meet him. Perhaps he will accept me.”"},{"p":6,"t":"So the gifts were sent on ahead of him while he spent that night in the camp."},{"p":7,"t":"During the night Jacob quickly took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok."},{"p":7,"t":"He took them and sent them across the stream along with all his possessions."},{"p":7,"t":"So Jacob was left alone. Then a man wrestled with him until daybreak."},{"p":7,"t":"When the man saw that he could not defeat Jacob, he struck the socket of his hip so the socket of Jacob’s hip was dislocated while he wrestled with him."},{"p":8,"t":"Then the man said, “Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.” “I will not let you go,” Jacob replied, “unless you bless me.”"},{"p":8,"t":"The man asked him, “What is your name?” He answered, “Jacob.”"},{"p":8,"t":"“No longer will your name be Jacob,” the man told him, “but Israel, because you have fought with God and with men and have prevailed.”"},{"p":9,"t":"Then Jacob asked, “Please tell me your name.” “Why do you ask my name?” the man replied. Then he blessed Jacob there."},{"p":9,"t":"So Jacob named the place Peniel, explaining, “Certainly I have seen God face to face and have survived.”"},{"p":10,"t":"The sun rose over him as he crossed over Penuel, but he was limping because of his hip."},{"p":10,"t":"That is why to this day the Israelites do not eat the sinew which is attached to the socket of the hip, because he struck the socket of Jacob’s hip near the attached sinew."}],[{"p":1,"t":"Jacob looked up and saw that Esau was coming along with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two female servants."},{"p":1,"t":"He put the servants and their children in front, with Leah and her children behind them, and Rachel and Joseph behind them."},{"p":1,"t":"But Jacob himself went on ahead of them, and he bowed toward the ground seven times as he approached his brother."},{"p":1,"t":"But Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, hugged his neck, and kissed him. Then they both wept."},{"p":1,"t":"When Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, he asked, “Who are these people with you?” Jacob replied, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”"},{"p":1,"t":"The female servants came forward with their children and bowed down."},{"p":1,"t":"Then Leah came forward with her children and they bowed down. Finally Joseph and Rachel came forward and bowed down."},{"p":2,"t":"Esau then asked, “What did you intend by sending all these herds to meet me?” Jacob replied, “To find favor in your sight, my lord.”"},{"p":2,"t":"But Esau said, “I have plenty, my brother. Keep what belongs to you.”"},{"p":2,"t":"“No, please take them,” Jacob said. “If I have found favor in your sight, accept my gift from my hand. Now that I have seen your face and you have accepted me, it is as if I have seen the face of God."},{"p":2,"t":"Please take my present that was brought to you, for God has been generous to me and I have all I need.” When Jacob urged him, he took it."},{"p":3,"t":"Then Esau said, “Let’s be on our way! I will go in front of you.”"},{"p":3,"t":"But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are young, and that I have to look after the sheep and cattle that are nursing their young. If they are driven too hard for even a single day, all the animals will die."},{"p":3,"t":"Let my lord go on ahead of his servant. I will travel more slowly, at the pace of the herds and the children, until I come to my lord at Seir.”"},{"p":4,"t":"So Esau said, “Let me leave some of my men with you.” “Why do that?” Jacob replied. “My lord has already been kind enough to me.”"},{"p":5,"t":"So that same day Esau made his way back to Seir."},{"p":5,"t":"But Jacob traveled to Succoth where he built himself a house and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place was called Succoth."},{"p":6,"t":"After he left Paddan Aram, Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and he camped near the city."},{"p":6,"t":"Then he purchased the portion of the field where he had pitched his tent; he bought it from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of money."},{"p":6,"t":"There he set up an altar and called it “The God of Israel is God.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"Now Dinah, Leah’s daughter whom she bore to Jacob, went to meet the young women of the land."},{"p":1,"t":"When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, who ruled that area, saw her, he grabbed her, forced himself on her, and sexually assaulted her."},{"p":1,"t":"Then he became very attached to Dinah, Jacob’s daughter. He fell in love with the young woman and spoke romantically to her."},{"p":1,"t":"Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Acquire this young girl as my wife.”"},{"p":1,"t":"When Jacob heard that Shechem had violated his daughter Dinah, his sons were with the livestock in the field. So Jacob remained silent until they came in."},{"p":2,"t":"Then Shechem’s father Hamor went to speak with Jacob about Dinah."},{"p":2,"t":"Now Jacob’s sons had come in from the field when they heard the news. They were offended and very angry because Shechem had disgraced Israel by sexually assaulting Jacob’s daughter, a crime that should not be committed."},{"p":3,"t":"But Hamor made this appeal to them: “My son Shechem is in love with your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife."},{"p":3,"t":"Intermarry with us. Let us marry your daughters, and take our daughters as wives for yourselves."},{"p":3,"t":"You may live among us, and the land will be open to you. Live in it, travel freely in it, and acquire property in it.”"},{"p":4,"t":"Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Let me find favor in your sight, and whatever you require of me I’ll give."},{"p":4,"t":"You can make the bride price and the gift I must bring very expensive, and I’ll give whatever you ask of me. Just give me the young woman as my wife!”"},{"p":5,"t":"Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully when they spoke because Shechem had violated their sister Dinah."},{"p":5,"t":"They said to them, “We cannot give our sister to a man who is not circumcised, for it would be a disgrace to us."},{"p":5,"t":"We will give you our consent on this one condition: You must become like us by circumcising all your males."},{"p":5,"t":"Then we will give you our daughters to marry, and we will take your daughters as wives for ourselves, and we will live among you and become one people."},{"p":5,"t":"But if you do not agree to our terms by being circumcised, then we will take our sister and depart.”"},{"p":6,"t":"Their offer pleased Hamor and his son Shechem."},{"p":6,"t":"The young man did not delay in doing what they asked because he wanted Jacob’s daughter Dinah badly. (Now he was more important than anyone in his father’s household.)"},{"p":6,"t":"So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city,"},{"p":6,"t":"“These men are at peace with us. So let them live in the land and travel freely in it, for the land is wide enough for them. We will take their daughters for wives, and we will give them our daughters to marry."},{"p":6,"t":"Only on this one condition will these men consent to live with us and become one people: They demand that every male among us be circumcised just as they are circumcised."},{"p":6,"t":"If we do so, won’t their livestock, their property, and all their animals become ours? So let’s consent to their demand, so they will live among us.”"},{"p":7,"t":"All the men who assembled at the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem. Every male who assembled at the city gate was circumcised."},{"p":7,"t":"In three days, when they were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword and went to the unsuspecting city and slaughtered every male."},{"p":7,"t":"They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword, took Dinah from Shechem’s house, and left."},{"p":7,"t":"Jacob’s sons killed them and looted the city because their sister had been violated."},{"p":7,"t":"They took their flocks, herds, and donkeys, as well as everything in the city and in the surrounding fields."},{"p":7,"t":"They captured as plunder all their wealth, all their little ones, and their wives, including everything in the houses."},{"p":8,"t":"Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought ruin on me by making me a foul odor among the inhabitants of the land &#8211; among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number; they will join forces against me and attack me, and both I and my family will be destroyed!”"},{"p":8,"t":"But Simeon and Levi replied, “Should he treat our sister like a common prostitute?”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"Then God said to Jacob, “Go up at once to Bethel and live there. Make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”"},{"p":1,"t":"So Jacob told his household and all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods you have among you.

Then I will make an altar there to God, who responded to me in my time of distress and has been with me wherever I went.”"},{"p":2,"t":"So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods that were in their possession and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob buried them under the oak near Shechem"},{"p":2,"t":"and they started on their journey. The surrounding cities were afraid of God, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob."},{"p":3,"t":"Jacob and all those who were with him arrived at Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan."},{"p":3,"t":"He built an altar there and named the place El Bethel because there God had revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother."},{"p":3,"t":"(Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak below Bethel; thus it was named Oak of Weeping.)"},{"p":4,"t":"God appeared to Jacob again after he returned from Paddan Aram and blessed him."},{"p":4,"t":"God said to him, “Your name is Jacob, but your name will no longer be called Jacob; Israel will be your name.” So God named him Israel."},{"p":4,"t":"Then God said to him, “I am the sovereign God.

Go down there and buy grain for us so that we may live and not die.”"},{"p":2,"t":"So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt."},{"p":2,"t":"But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, “What if some accident happens to him?”"},{"p":2,"t":"So Israel’s sons came to buy grain among the other travelers, for the famine was severe in the land of Canaan."},{"p":3,"t":"Now Joseph was the ruler of the country, the one who sold grain to all the people of the country. Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the ground."},{"p":3,"t":"When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger to them and spoke to them harshly. He asked, “Where do you come from?” They answered, “From the land of Canaan, to buy grain for food.”"},{"p":4,"t":"Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him."},{"p":4,"t":"Then Joseph remembered the dreams he had dreamed about them, and he said to them, “You are spies; you have come to see if our land is vulnerable!”"},{"p":5,"t":"But they exclaimed, “No, my lord! Your servants have come to buy grain for food!"},{"p":5,"t":"We are all the sons of one man; we are honest men! Your servants are not spies.”"},{"p":6,"t":"“No,” he insisted, “but you have come to see if our land is vulnerable.”"},{"p":6,"t":"They replied, “Your servants are from a family of twelve brothers. We are the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is with our father at this time, and one is no longer alive.”"},{"p":7,"t":"But Joseph told them, “It is just as I said to you: You are spies!"},{"p":7,"t":"You will be tested in this way: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not depart from this place unless your youngest brother comes here."},{"p":7,"t":"One of you must go and get your brother, while the rest of you remain in prison. In this way your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If not, then, as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!”"},{"p":7,"t":"He imprisoned them all for three days."},{"p":7,"t":"On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do as I say and you will live, for I fear God."},{"p":7,"t":"If you are honest men, leave one of your brothers confined here in prison while the rest of you go and take grain back for your hungry families."},{"p":7,"t":"But you must bring your youngest brother to me. Then your words will be verified and you will not die.” They did as he said."},{"p":8,"t":"They said to one other, “Surely we’re being punished because of our brother, because we saw how distressed he was when he cried to us for mercy, but we refused to listen. That is why this distress has come on us!”"},{"p":8,"t":"Reuben said to them, “Didn’t I say to you, ‘Don’t sin against the boy,’ but you wouldn’t listen? So now we must pay for shedding his blood!”"},{"p":8,"t":"(Now they did not know that Joseph could understand them, for he was speaking through an interpreter.)"},{"p":8,"t":"He turned away from them and wept. When he turned around and spoke to them again, he had Simeon taken from them and tied up before their eyes."},{"p":9,"t":"Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to return each man’s money to his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. His orders were carried out."},{"p":9,"t":"So they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left."},{"p":10,"t":"When one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey at their resting place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack."},{"p":10,"t":"He said to his brothers, “My money was returned! Here it is in my sack!” They were dismayed; they turned trembling one to another and said, “What in the world has God done to us?”"},{"p":11,"t":"They returned to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan and told him all the things that had happened to them, saying,"},{"p":11,"t":"“The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly to us and treated us as if we were spying on the land."},{"p":11,"t":"But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies!"},{"p":11,"t":"We are from a family of twelve brothers; we are the sons of one father. One is no longer alive, and the youngest is with our father at this time in the land of Canaan.’"},{"p":12,"t":"“Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘This is how I will find out if you are honest men. Leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for your hungry households and go."},{"p":12,"t":"But bring your youngest brother back to me so I will know that you are honest men and not spies. Then I will give your brother back to you and you may move about freely in the land.’”"},{"p":13,"t":"When they were emptying their sacks, there was each man’s bag of money in his sack! When they and their father saw the bags of money, they were afraid."},{"p":13,"t":"Their father Jacob said to them, “You are making me childless! Joseph is gone. Simeon is gone. And now you want to take Benjamin! Everything is against me.”"},{"p":14,"t":"Then Reuben said to his father, “You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my care and I will bring him back to you.”"},{"p":14,"t":"But Jacob replied, “My son will not go down there with you, for his brother is dead and he alone is left. If an accident happens to him on the journey you have to make, then you will bring down my gray hair in sorrow to the grave.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"Now the famine was severe in the land."},{"p":1,"t":"When they finished eating the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Return, buy us a little more food.”"},{"p":2,"t":"But Judah said to him, “The man solemnly warned us, ‘You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.’"},{"p":2,"t":"If you send our brother with us, we’ll go down and buy food for you."},{"p":2,"t":"But if you will not send him, we won’t go down there because the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.’”"},{"p":3,"t":"Israel said, “Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had one more brother?”"},{"p":4,"t":"They replied, “The man questioned us thoroughly about ourselves and our family, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ So we answered him in this way. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”"},{"p":5,"t":"Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy with me and we will go immediately. Then we will live and not die &#8211; we and you and our little ones."},{"p":5,"t":"I myself pledge security for him; you may hold me liable. If I do not bring him back to you and place him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life."},{"p":5,"t":"But if we had not delayed, we could have traveled there and back twice by now!”"},{"p":6,"t":"Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Take some of the best products of the land in your bags, and take a gift down to the man &#8211; a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachios and almonds."},{"p":6,"t":"Take double the money with you; you must take back the money that was returned in the mouths of your sacks &#8211; perhaps it was an oversight."},{"p":6,"t":"Take your brother too, and go right away to the man."},{"p":6,"t":"May the sovereign God grant you mercy before the man so that he may release your other brother and Benjamin! As for me, if I lose my children I lose them.”"},{"p":7,"t":"So the men took these gifts, and they took double the money with them, along with Benjamin. Then they hurried down to Egypt and stood before Joseph."},{"p":7,"t":"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the servant who was over his household, “Bring the men to the house. Slaughter an animal and prepare it, for the men will eat with me at noon.”"},{"p":7,"t":"The man did just as Joseph said; he brought the men into Joseph’s house."},{"p":8,"t":"But the men were afraid when they were brought to Joseph’s house. They said, “We are being brought in because of the money that was returned in our sacks last time. He wants to capture us, make us slaves, and take our donkeys!”"},{"p":8,"t":"So they approached the man who was in charge of Joseph’s household and spoke to him at the entrance to the house."},{"p":8,"t":"They said, “My lord, we did indeed come down the first time to buy food."},{"p":8,"t":"But when we came to the place where we spent the night, we opened our sacks and each of us found his money &#8211; the full amount &#8211; in the mouth of his sack. So we have returned it."},{"p":8,"t":"We have brought additional money with us to buy food. We do not know who put the money in our sacks!”"},{"p":9,"t":"“Everything is fine,” the man in charge of Joseph’s household told them. “Don’t be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks. I had your money.” Then he brought Simeon out to them."},{"p":10,"t":"The servant in charge brought the men into Joseph’s house. He gave them water, and they washed their feet. Then he gave food to their donkeys."},{"p":10,"t":"They got their gifts ready for Joseph’s arrival at noon, for they had heard that they were to have a meal there."},{"p":11,"t":"When Joseph came home, they presented him with the gifts they had brought inside, and they bowed down to the ground before him."},{"p":11,"t":"He asked them how they were doing. Then he said, “Is your aging father well, the one you spoke about? Is he still alive?”"},{"p":11,"t":"“Your servant our father is well,” they replied. “He is still alive.” They bowed down in humility."},{"p":12,"t":"When Joseph looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, he said, “Is this your youngest brother, whom you told me about?” Then he said, “May God be gracious to you, my son.”"},{"p":12,"t":"Joseph hurried out, for he was overcome by affection for his brother and was at the point of tears. So he went to his room and wept there."},{"p":13,"t":"Then he washed his face and came out. With composure he said, “Set out the food.”"},{"p":13,"t":"They set a place for him, a separate place for his brothers, and another for the Egyptians who were eating with him. (The Egyptians are not able to eat with Hebrews, for the Egyptians think it is disgusting to do so.)"},{"p":13,"t":"They sat before him, arranged by order of birth, beginning with the firstborn and ending with the youngest. The men looked at each other in astonishment."},{"p":13,"t":"He gave them portions of the food set before him, but the portion for Benjamin was five times greater than the portions for any of the others. They drank with Joseph until they all became drunk."}],[{"p":1,"t":"He instructed the servant who was over his household, “Fill the sacks of the men with as much food as they can carry and put each man’s money in the mouth of his sack."},{"p":1,"t":"Then put my cup &#8211; the silver cup &#8211; in the mouth of the youngest one’s sack, along with the money for his grain.” He did as Joseph instructed."},{"p":2,"t":"When morning came, the men and their donkeys were sent off."},{"p":2,"t":"They had not gone very far from the city when Joseph said to the servant who was over his household, “Pursue the men at once! When you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil?"},{"p":2,"t":"Doesn’t my master drink from this cup and use it for divination? You have done wrong!’”"},{"p":3,"t":"When the man overtook them, he spoke these words to them."},{"p":3,"t":"They answered him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!"},{"p":3,"t":"Look, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. Why then would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?"},{"p":3,"t":"If one of us has it, he will die, and the rest of us will become my lord’s slaves!”"},{"p":4,"t":"He replied, “You have suggested your own punishment! The one who has it will become my slave, but the rest of you will go free.”"},{"p":4,"t":"So each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it."},{"p":4,"t":"Then the man searched. He began with the oldest and finished with the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin’s sack!"},{"p":4,"t":"They all tore their clothes! Then each man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city."},{"p":5,"t":"So Judah and his brothers came back to Joseph’s house. He was still there, and they threw themselves to the ground before him."},{"p":5,"t":"Joseph said to them, “What did you think you were doing? Don’t you know that a man like me can find out things like this by divination?”"},{"p":6,"t":"Judah replied, “What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? How can we clear ourselves? God has exposed the sin of your servants! We are now my lord’s slaves, we and the one in whose possession the cup was found.”"},{"p":7,"t":"But Joseph said, “Far be it from me to do this! The man in whose hand the cup was found will become my slave, but the rest of you may go back to your father in peace.”"},{"p":8,"t":"Then Judah approached him and said, “My lord, please allow your servant to speak a word with you. Please do not get angry with your servant, for you are just like Pharaoh."},{"p":8,"t":"My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’"},{"p":8,"t":"We said to my lord, ‘We have an aged father, and there is a young boy who was born when our father was old. The boy’s brother is dead. He is the only one of his mother’s sons left, and his father loves him.’"},{"p":9,"t":"“Then you told your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so I can see him.’"},{"p":9,"t":"We said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father. If he leaves his father, his father will die.’"},{"p":9,"t":"But you said to your servants, ‘If your youngest brother does not come down with you, you will not see my face again.’"},{"p":9,"t":"When we returned to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord."},{"p":10,"t":"“Then our father said, ‘Go back and buy us a little food.’"},{"p":10,"t":"But we replied, ‘We cannot go down there. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go, for we won’t be permitted to see the man’s face if our youngest brother is not with us.’"},{"p":11,"t":"“Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife gave me two sons."},{"p":11,"t":"The first disappeared and I said, “He has surely been torn to pieces.” I have not seen him since."},{"p":11,"t":"If you take this one from me too and an accident happens to him, then you will bring down my gray hair in tragedy to the grave.’"},{"p":12,"t":"“So now, when I return to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us &#8211; his very life is bound up in his son’s life."},{"p":12,"t":"When he sees the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father in sorrow to the grave."},{"p":12,"t":"Indeed, your servant pledged security for the boy with my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, then I will bear the blame before my father all my life.’"},{"p":13,"t":"“So now, please let your servant remain as my lord’s slave instead of the boy. As for the boy, let him go back with his brothers."},{"p":13,"t":"For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I couldn’t bear to see my father’s pain.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"Joseph was no longer able to control himself before all his attendants, so he cried out, “Make everyone go out from my presence!” No one remained with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers."},{"p":1,"t":"He wept loudly; the Egyptians heard it and Pharaoh’s household heard about it."},{"p":2,"t":"Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” His brothers could not answer him because they were dumbfounded before him."},{"p":2,"t":"Joseph said to his brothers, “Come closer to me,” so they came near. Then he said, “I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt."},{"p":2,"t":"Now, do not be upset and do not be angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me ahead of you to preserve life!"},{"p":2,"t":"For these past two years there has been famine in the land and for five more years there will be neither plowing nor harvesting."},{"p":2,"t":"God sent me ahead of you to preserve you on the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance."},{"p":2,"t":"So now, it is not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me an adviser to Pharaoh, lord over all his household, and ruler over all the land of Egypt."},{"p":2,"t":"Now go up to my father quickly and tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: “God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; do not delay!"},{"p":2,"t":"You will live in the land of Goshen, and you will be near me &#8211; you, your children, your grandchildren, your flocks, your herds, and everything you have."},{"p":2,"t":"I will provide you with food there because there will be five more years of famine. Otherwise you would become poor &#8211; you, your household, and everyone who belongs to you.”’"},{"p":2,"t":"You and my brother Benjamin can certainly see with your own eyes that I really am the one who speaks to you."},{"p":2,"t":"So tell my father about all my honor in Egypt and about everything you have seen. But bring my father down here quickly!”"},{"p":3,"t":"Then he threw himself on the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck."},{"p":3,"t":"He kissed all his brothers and wept over them. After this his brothers talked with him."},{"p":4,"t":"Now it was reported in the household of Pharaoh, “Joseph’s brothers have arrived.” It pleased Pharaoh and his servants."},{"p":4,"t":"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and go to the land of Canaan!"},{"p":4,"t":"Get your father and your households and come to me! Then I will give you the best land in Egypt and you will eat the best of the land.’"},{"p":4,"t":"You are also commanded to say, ‘Do this: Take for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives. Bring your father and come."},{"p":4,"t":"Don’t worry about your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt will be yours.’”"},{"p":5,"t":"So the sons of Israel did as he said. Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh had instructed, and he gave them provisions for the journey."},{"p":5,"t":"He gave sets of clothes to each one of them, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five sets of clothes."},{"p":5,"t":"To his father he sent the following: ten donkeys loaded with the best products of Egypt and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, food, and provisions for his father’s journey."},{"p":5,"t":"Then he sent his brothers on their way and they left. He said to them, “As you travel don’t be overcome with fear.”"},{"p":6,"t":"So they went up from Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan."},{"p":6,"t":"They told him, “Joseph is still alive and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!” Jacob was stunned, for he did not believe them."},{"p":6,"t":"But when they related to him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to transport him, their father Jacob’s spirit revived."},{"p":6,"t":"Then Israel said, “Enough! My son Joseph is still alive! I will go and see him before I die.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"So Israel began his journey, taking with him all that he had. When he came to Beer Sheba he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac."},{"p":1,"t":"God spoke to Israel in a vision during the night and said, “Jacob, Jacob!” He replied, “Here I am!”"},{"p":1,"t":"He said, “I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there."},{"p":1,"t":"I will go down with you to Egypt and I myself will certainly bring you back from there. Joseph will close your eyes.”"},{"p":2,"t":"Then Jacob started out from Beer Sheba, and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob, their little children, and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent along to transport him."},{"p":2,"t":"Jacob and all his descendants took their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and they went to Egypt."},{"p":2,"t":"He brought with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons, his daughters and granddaughters &#8211; all his descendants."},{"p":3,"t":"These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt &#8211; Jacob and his sons: Reuben, the firstborn of Jacob."},{"p":4,"t":"The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi."},{"p":5,"t":"The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul (the son of a Canaanite woman)."},{"p":6,"t":"The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."},{"p":7,"t":"The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan).

She bore these to Jacob, seven in all."},{"p":21,"t":"All the direct descendants of Jacob who went to Egypt with him were sixty-six in number. (This number does not include the wives of Jacob’s sons.)"},{"p":21,"t":"Counting the two sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt, all the people of the household of Jacob who were in Egypt numbered seventy."},{"p":22,"t":"Jacob sent Judah before him to Joseph to accompany him to Goshen. So they came to the land of Goshen."},{"p":22,"t":"Joseph harnessed his chariot and went up to meet his father Israel in Goshen. When he met him, he hugged his neck and wept on his neck for quite some time."},{"p":23,"t":"Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.”"},{"p":23,"t":"Then Joseph said to his brothers and his father’s household, “I will go up and tell Pharaoh, ‘My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Canaan have come to me."},{"p":23,"t":"The men are shepherds; they take care of livestock. They have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.’"},{"p":23,"t":"Pharaoh will summon you and say, ‘What is your occupation?’"},{"p":23,"t":"Tell him, ‘Your servants have taken care of cattle from our youth until now, both we and our fathers,’ so that you may live in the land of Goshen, for everyone who takes care of sheep is disgusting to the Egyptians.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"Joseph went and told Pharaoh, “My father, my brothers, their flocks and herds, and all that they own have arrived from the land of Canaan. They are now in the land of Goshen.”"},{"p":2,"t":"He took five of his brothers and introduced them to Pharaoh."},{"p":3,"t":"Pharaoh said to Joseph’s brothers, “What is your occupation?” They said to Pharaoh, “Your servants take care of flocks, just as our ancestors did.”"},{"p":3,"t":"Then they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live as temporary residents in the land. There is no pasture for your servants’ flocks because the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. So now, please let your servants live in the land of Goshen.”"},{"p":4,"t":"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you."},{"p":4,"t":"The land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best region of the land. They may live in the land of Goshen. If you know of any highly capable men among them, put them in charge of my livestock.”"},{"p":5,"t":"Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh. Jacob blessed Pharaoh."},{"p":5,"t":"Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How long have you lived?”"},{"p":5,"t":"Jacob said to Pharaoh, “All the years of my travels are 130. All the years of my life have been few and painful; the years of my travels are not as long as those of my ancestors.”"},{"p":5,"t":"Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from his presence."},{"p":6,"t":"So Joseph settled his father and his brothers. He gave them territory in the land of Egypt, in the best region of the land, the land of Rameses, just as Pharaoh had commanded."},{"p":6,"t":"Joseph also provided food for his father, his brothers, and all his father’s household, according to the number of their little children."},{"p":7,"t":"But there was no food in all the land because the famine was very severe; the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan wasted away because of the famine."},{"p":7,"t":"Joseph collected all the money that could be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan as payment for the grain they were buying. Then Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s palace."},{"p":7,"t":"When the money from the lands of Egypt and Canaan was used up, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food! Why should we die before your very eyes because our money has run out?”"},{"p":8,"t":"Then Joseph said, “If your money is gone, bring your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock.”"},{"p":8,"t":"So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for their horses, the livestock of their flocks and herds, and their donkeys. He got them through that year by giving them food in exchange for livestock."},{"p":9,"t":"When that year was over, they came to him the next year and said to him, “We cannot hide from our lord that the money is used up and the livestock and the animals belong to our lord. Nothing remains before our lord except our bodies and our land."},{"p":9,"t":"Why should we die before your very eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we, with our land, will become Pharaoh’s slaves. Give us seed that we may live and not die. Then the land will not become desolate.”"},{"p":10,"t":"So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh. Each of the Egyptians sold his field, for the famine was severe. So the land became Pharaoh’s."},{"p":10,"t":"Joseph made all the people slaves from one end of Egypt’s border to the other end of it."},{"p":10,"t":"But he did not purchase the land of the priests because the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh and they ate from their allotment that Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land."},{"p":11,"t":"Joseph said to the people, “Since I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you. Cultivate the land."},{"p":11,"t":"When you gather in the crop, give one-fifth of it to Pharaoh, and the rest will be yours for seed for the fields and for you to eat, including those in your households and your little children.”"},{"p":11,"t":"They replied, “You have saved our lives! You are showing us favor, and we will be Pharaoh’s slaves.”"},{"p":12,"t":"So Joseph made it a statute, which is in effect to this day throughout the land of Egypt: One-fifth belongs to Pharaoh. Only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh’s."},{"p":13,"t":"Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they owned land there. They were fruitful and increased rapidly in number."},{"p":14,"t":"Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; the years of Jacob’s life were 147 in all."},{"p":14,"t":"The time for Israel to die approached, so he called for his son Joseph and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh and show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt,"},{"p":14,"t":"but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place.” Joseph said, “I will do as you say.”"},{"p":15,"t":"Jacob said, “Swear to me that you will do so.” So Joseph gave him his word. Then Israel bowed down at the head of his bed."}],[{"p":1,"t":"After these things Joseph was told, “Your father is weakening.” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him."},{"p":1,"t":"When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has just come to you,” Israel regained strength and sat up on his bed."},{"p":1,"t":"Jacob said to Joseph, “The sovereign God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me."},{"p":1,"t":"He said to me, ‘I am going to make you fruitful and will multiply you. I will make you into a group of nations, and I will give this land to your descendants as an everlasting possession.’"},{"p":2,"t":"“Now, as for your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, they will be mine. Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine just as Reuben and Simeon are."},{"p":2,"t":"Any children that you father after them will be yours; they will be listed under the names of their brothers in their inheritance."},{"p":2,"t":"But as for me, when I was returning from Paddan, Rachel died &#8211; to my sorrow &#8211; in the land of Canaan. It happened along the way, some distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there on the way to Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem)."},{"p":3,"t":"When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he asked, “Who are these?”"},{"p":3,"t":"Joseph said to his father, “They are the sons God has given me in this place.” His father said, “Bring them to me so I may bless them.”"},{"p":3,"t":"Now Israel’s eyes were failing because of his age; he was not able to see well. So Joseph brought his sons near to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them."},{"p":3,"t":"Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see you again, but now God has allowed me to see your children too.”"},{"p":4,"t":"So Joseph moved them from Israel’s knees and bowed down with his face to the ground."},{"p":4,"t":"Joseph positioned them; he put Ephraim on his right hand across from Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh on his left hand across from Israel’s right hand. Then Joseph brought them closer to his father."},{"p":4,"t":"Israel stretched out his right hand and placed it on Ephraim’s head, although he was the younger. Crossing his hands, he put his left hand on Manasseh’s head, for Manasseh was the firstborn."},{"p":5,"t":"Then he blessed Joseph and said, “May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked &#8211; the God who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day,"},{"p":6,"t":"the Angel who has protected me from all harm &#8211; bless these boys. May my name be named in them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac.

So he took his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head."},{"p":7,"t":"Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.”"},{"p":8,"t":"But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He too will become a nation and he too will become great. In spite of this, his younger brother will be even greater and his descendants will become a multitude of nations.”"},{"p":8,"t":"So he blessed them that day, saying, “By you will Israel bless, saying, ‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’” So he put Ephraim before Manasseh."},{"p":9,"t":"Then Israel said to Joseph, “I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your fathers."},{"p":9,"t":"As one who is above your brothers, I give to you the mountain slope, which I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"Jacob called for his sons and said, “Gather together so I can tell you what will happen to you in the future."},{"p":2,"t":"“Assemble and listen, you sons of Jacob; listen to Israel, your father."},{"p":3,"t":"Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might and the beginning of my strength, outstanding in dignity, outstanding in power."},{"p":4,"t":"You are destructive like water and will not excel, for you got on your father’s bed, then you defiled it &#8211; he got on my couch!"},{"p":5,"t":"Simeon and Levi are brothers, weapons of violence are their knives!"},{"p":6,"t":"O my soul, do not come into their council, do not be united to their assembly, my heart, for in their anger they have killed men, and for pleasure they have hamstrung oxen."},{"p":7,"t":"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce, and their fury, for it was cruel. I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel!"},{"p":8,"t":"Judah, your brothers will praise you.

He wept over him and kissed him."},{"p":1,"t":"Joseph instructed the physicians in his service to embalm his father, so the physicians embalmed Israel."},{"p":1,"t":"They took forty days, for that is the full time needed for embalming.
