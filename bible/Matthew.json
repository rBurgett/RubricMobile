I will observe the Passover with my disciples at your house.”’”"},{"p":4,"t":"So the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they prepared the Passover."},{"p":4,"t":"When it was evening, he took his place at the table with the twelve."},{"p":4,"t":"And while they were eating he said, “I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.”"},{"p":4,"t":"They became greatly distressed and each one began to say to him, “Surely not I, Lord?”"},{"p":4,"t":"He answered, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me."},{"p":4,"t":"The Son of Man will go as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if he had never been born.”"},{"p":4,"t":"Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” Jesus replied, “You have said it yourself.”"},{"p":5,"t":"While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it, gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat, this is my body.”"},{"p":5,"t":"And after taking the cup and giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you,"},{"p":5,"t":"for this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, that is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."},{"p":5,"t":"I tell you, from now on I will not drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”"},{"p":5,"t":"After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives."},{"p":6,"t":"Then Jesus said to them, “This night you will all fall away because of me, for it is written: ‘<b>I will strike the shepherd,</b> <b>and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</b>’"},{"p":7,"t":"But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”"},{"p":7,"t":"Peter said to him, “If they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away!”"},{"p":7,"t":"Jesus said to him, “I tell you the truth, on this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”"},{"p":7,"t":"Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you.” And all the disciples said the same thing."},{"p":8,"t":"Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”"},{"p":8,"t":"He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and became anguished and distressed."},{"p":8,"t":"Then he said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me.”"},{"p":8,"t":"Going a little farther, he threw himself down with his face to the ground and prayed, “My Father, if possible, let this cup pass from me! Yet not what I will, but what you will.”"},{"p":8,"t":"Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, “So, couldn’t you stay awake with me for one hour?"},{"p":8,"t":"Stay awake and pray that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”"},{"p":8,"t":"He went away a second time and prayed, “My Father, if this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it, your will must be done.”"},{"p":8,"t":"He came again and found them sleeping; they could not keep their eyes open."},{"p":8,"t":"So leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same thing once more."},{"p":8,"t":"Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is approaching, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."},{"p":8,"t":"Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer is approaching!”"},{"p":9,"t":"While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people."},{"p":9,"t":"(Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him!”)"},{"p":9,"t":"Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi,” and kissed him."},{"p":9,"t":"Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you are here to do.” Then they came and took hold of Jesus and arrested him."},{"p":9,"t":"But one of those with Jesus grabbed his sword, drew it out, and struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his ear."},{"p":9,"t":"Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back in its place! For all who take hold of the sword will die by the sword."},{"p":9,"t":"Or do you think that I cannot call on my Father, and that he would send me more than twelve legions of angels right now?"},{"p":9,"t":"How then would the scriptures that say it must happen this way be fulfilled?”"},{"p":9,"t":"At that moment Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me like you would an outlaw? Day after day I sat teaching in the temple courts, yet you did not arrest me."},{"p":9,"t":"But this has happened so that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples left him and fled."},{"p":10,"t":"Now the ones who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, in whose house the experts in the law and the elders had gathered."},{"p":10,"t":"But Peter was following him from a distance, all the way to the high priest’s courtyard. After going in, he sat with the guards to see the outcome."},{"p":10,"t":"The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were trying to find false testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death."},{"p":10,"t":"But they did not find anything, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward"},{"p":10,"t":"and declared, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”"},{"p":10,"t":"So the high priest stood up and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is this that they are testifying against you?”"},{"p":10,"t":"But Jesus was silent. The high priest said to him, “I charge you under oath by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.”"},{"p":10,"t":"Jesus said to him, “You have said it yourself. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”"},{"p":10,"t":"Then the high priest tore his clothes and declared, “He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? Now you have heard the blasphemy!"},{"p":10,"t":"What is your verdict?” They answered, “He is guilty and deserves death.”"},{"p":10,"t":"Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists. And some slapped him,"},{"p":10,"t":"saying, “Prophesy for us, you Christ! Who hit you?”"},{"p":11,"t":"Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A slave girl came to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”"},{"p":11,"t":"But he denied it in front of them all: “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”"},{"p":11,"t":"When he went out to the gateway, another slave girl saw him and said to the people there, “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.”"},{"p":11,"t":"He denied it again with an oath, “I do not know the man!”"},{"p":11,"t":"After a little while, those standing there came up to Peter and said, “You really are one of them too &#8211; even your accent gives you away!”"},{"p":11,"t":"At that he began to curse, and he swore with an oath, “I do not know the man!” At that moment a rooster crowed."},{"p":11,"t":"Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly."}],[{"p":1,"t":"When it was early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted against Jesus to execute him."},{"p":1,"t":"They tied him up, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate the governor."},{"p":2,"t":"Now when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned, he regretted what he had done and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders,"},{"p":2,"t":"saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood!” But they said, “What is that to us? You take care of it yourself!”"},{"p":2,"t":"So Judas threw the silver coins into the temple and left. Then he went out and hanged himself."},{"p":2,"t":"The chief priests took the silver and said, “It is not lawful to put this into the temple treasury, since it is blood money.”"},{"p":2,"t":"After consulting together they bought the Potter’s Field with it, as a burial place for foreigners."},{"p":2,"t":"For this reason that field has been called the “Field of Blood” to this day."},{"p":2,"t":"Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty silver coins, the price of the one whose price had been set by the people of Israel,"},{"p":2,"t":"and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”"},{"p":3,"t":"Then Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus said, “You say so.”"},{"p":3,"t":"But when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he did not respond."},{"p":3,"t":"Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many charges they are bringing against you?”"},{"p":3,"t":"But he did not answer even one accusation, so that the governor was quite amazed."},{"p":4,"t":"During the feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd, whomever they wanted."},{"p":4,"t":"At that time they had in custody a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas."},{"p":4,"t":"So after they had assembled, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Christ?”"},{"p":4,"t":"(For he knew that they had handed him over because of envy.)"},{"p":4,"t":"As he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent a message to him: “Have nothing to do with that innocent man; I have suffered greatly as a result of a dream about him today.”"},{"p":4,"t":"But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed."},{"p":4,"t":"The governor asked them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas!”"},{"p":4,"t":"Pilate said to them, “Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?” They all said, “Crucify him!”"},{"p":4,"t":"He asked, “Why? What wrong has he done?” But they shouted more insistently, “Crucify him!”"},{"p":5,"t":"When Pilate saw that he could do nothing, but that instead a riot was starting, he took some water, washed his hands before the crowd and said, “I am innocent of this man’s blood. You take care of it yourselves!”"},{"p":5,"t":"In reply all the people said, “Let his blood be on us and on our children!”"},{"p":5,"t":"Then he released Barabbas for them. But after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified."},{"p":5,"t":"Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s residence and gathered the whole cohort around him."},{"p":5,"t":"They stripped him and put a scarlet robe around him,"},{"p":5,"t":"and after braiding a crown of thorns, they put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand, and kneeling down before him, they mocked him: “Hail, king of the Jews!”"},{"p":5,"t":"They spat on him and took the staff and struck him repeatedly on the head."},{"p":5,"t":"When they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to crucify him."},{"p":6,"t":"As they were going out, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they forced to carry his cross."},{"p":6,"t":"They came to a place called Golgotha (which means “Place of the Skull”)"},{"p":6,"t":"and offered Jesus wine mixed with gall to drink. But after tasting it, he would not drink it."},{"p":6,"t":"When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes by throwing dice."},{"p":6,"t":"Then they sat down and kept guard over him there."},{"p":6,"t":"Above his head they put the charge against him, which read: “This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.”"},{"p":6,"t":"Then two outlaws were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left."},{"p":6,"t":"Those who passed by defamed him, shaking their heads"},{"p":6,"t":"and saying, “You who can destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are God’s Son, come down from the cross!”"},{"p":6,"t":"In the same way even the chief priests &#8211; together with the experts in the law and elders &#8211; were mocking him:"},{"p":6,"t":"“He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the king of Israel!

Let’s see if Elijah will come to save him.”"},{"p":7,"t":"Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit."},{"p":7,"t":"Just then the temple curtain was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks were split apart."},{"p":7,"t":"And tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had died were raised."},{"p":7,"t":"(They came out of the tombs after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.)"},{"p":7,"t":"Now when the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and what took place, they were extremely terrified and said, “Truly this one was God’s Son!”"},{"p":7,"t":"Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee and given him support were also there, watching from a distance."},{"p":7,"t":"Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee."},{"p":8,"t":"Now when it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus."},{"p":8,"t":"He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered that it be given to him."},{"p":8,"t":"Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,"},{"p":8,"t":"and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut in the rock.

Go and make it as secure as you can.”"},{"p":9,"t":"So they went with the soldiers of the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone."}],[{"p":1,"t":"Now after the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb."},{"p":1,"t":"Suddenly there was a severe earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descending from heaven came and rolled away the stone and sat on it."},{"p":1,"t":"His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow."},{"p":1,"t":"The guards were shaken and became like dead men because they were so afraid of him."},{"p":1,"t":"But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."},{"p":1,"t":"He is not here, for he has been raised, just as he said. Come and see the place where he was lying."},{"p":1,"t":"Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there.’ Listen, I have told you!”"},{"p":1,"t":"So they left the tomb quickly, with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples."},{"p":1,"t":"But Jesus met them, saying, “Greetings!” They came to him, held on to his feet and worshiped him."},{"p":1,"t":"Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee.
