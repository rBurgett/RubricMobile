For they have paid no attention to what I have said, and they have rejected my law."},{"p":20,"t":"I take no delight when they offer up to me frankincense that comes from Sheba or sweet-smelling cane imported from a faraway land. I cannot accept the burnt offerings they bring me. I get no pleasure from the sacrifices they offer to me.’"},{"p":21,"t":"So, this is what the Lord says: ‘I will assuredly make these people stumble to their doom. Parents and children will stumble and fall to their destruction. Friends and neighbors will die.’"},{"p":22,"t":"“This is what the Lord says: ‘Beware! An army is coming from a land in the north. A mighty nation is stirring into action in faraway parts of the earth."},{"p":23,"t":"Its soldiers are armed with bows and spears. They are cruel and show no mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride forth on their horses. Lined up in formation like men going into battle to attack you, Daughter Zion.’”"},{"p":24,"t":"The people cry out, “We have heard reports about them! We have become helpless with fear! Anguish grips us, agony like that of a woman giving birth to a baby!"},{"p":25,"t":"Do not go out into the countryside. Do not travel on the roads. For the enemy is there with sword in hand. They are spreading terror everywhere.”"},{"p":26,"t":"So I said, “Oh, my dear people, put on sackcloth and roll in ashes. Mourn with painful sobs as though you had lost your only child. For any moment now that destructive army will come against us.”"},{"p":27,"t":"The Lord said to me, “I have made you like a metal assayer to test my people like ore. You are to observe them and evaluate how they behave.”"},{"p":28,"t":"I reported, “All of them are the most stubborn of rebels! They are as hard as bronze or iron. They go about telling lies. They all deal corruptly."},{"p":29,"t":"The fiery bellows of judgment burn fiercely. But there is too much dross to be removed. The process of refining them has proved useless. The wicked have not been purged."},{"p":30,"t":"They are regarded as ‘rejected silver’ because the Lord rejects them.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"The Lord said to Jeremiah:"},{"p":1,"t":"“Stand in the gate of the Lord’s temple and proclaim this message: ‘Listen, all you people of Judah who have passed through these gates to worship the Lord. Hear what the Lord has to say."},{"p":1,"t":"The Lord God of Israel who rules over all says: Change the way you have been living and do what is right. If you do, I will allow you to continue to live in this land."},{"p":1,"t":"Stop putting your confidence in the false belief that says, “We are safe! The temple of the Lord is here! The temple of the Lord is here! The temple of the Lord is here!”"},{"p":1,"t":"You must change the way you have been living and do what is right. You must treat one another fairly."},{"p":1,"t":"Stop oppressing foreigners who live in your land, children who have lost their fathers, and women who have lost their husbands. Stop killing innocent people in this land. Stop paying allegiance to other gods. That will only bring about your ruin."},{"p":1,"t":"If you stop doing these things, I will allow you to continue to live in this land which I gave to your ancestors as a lasting possession."},{"p":2,"t":"“‘But just look at you! You are putting your confidence in a false belief that will not deliver you."},{"p":2,"t":"You steal. You murder. You commit adultery. You lie when you swear on oath. You sacrifice to the god Baal. You pay allegiance to other gods whom you have not previously known."},{"p":2,"t":"Then you come and stand in my presence in this temple I have claimed as my own and say, “We are safe!” You think you are so safe that you go on doing all those hateful sins!"},{"p":2,"t":"Do you think this temple I have claimed as my own is to be a hideout for robbers? You had better take note! I have seen for myself what you have done! says the Lord."},{"p":2,"t":"So, go to the place in Shiloh where I allowed myself to be worshiped in the early days. See what I did to it because of the wicked things my people Israel did."},{"p":2,"t":"You also have done all these things, says the Lord, and I have spoken to you over and over again. But you have not listened! You have refused to respond when I called you to repent!"},{"p":2,"t":"So I will destroy this temple which I have claimed as my own, this temple that you are trusting to protect you. I will destroy this place that I gave to you and your ancestors, just like I destroyed Shiloh."},{"p":2,"t":"And I will drive you out of my sight just like I drove out your relatives, the people of Israel.’”"},{"p":3,"t":"Then the Lord said, “As for you, Jeremiah, do not pray for these people! Do not cry out to me or petition me on their behalf! Do not plead with me to save them, because I will not listen to you."},{"p":3,"t":"Do you see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?"},{"p":3,"t":"Children are gathering firewood, fathers are building fires with it, and women are mixing dough to bake cakes to offer to the goddess they call the Queen of Heaven. They are also pouring out drink offerings to other gods. They seem to do all this just to trouble me."},{"p":3,"t":"But I am not really the one being troubled!” says the Lord. “Rather they are bringing trouble on themselves to their own shame!"},{"p":3,"t":"So,” the Lord God says, “my raging fury will be poured out on this land. It will be poured out on human beings and animals, on trees and crops. And it will burn like a fire which cannot be extinguished.”"},{"p":4,"t":"The Lord said to the people of Judah, “The Lord God of Israel who rules over all says: ‘You might as well go ahead and add the meat of your burnt offerings to that of the other sacrifices and eat it, too!"},{"p":4,"t":"Consider this: When I spoke to your ancestors after I brought them out of Egypt, I did not merely give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices."},{"p":4,"t":"I also explicitly commanded them: “Obey me. If you do, I will be your God and you will be my people. Live exactly the way I tell you and things will go well with you.”"},{"p":4,"t":"But they did not listen to me or pay any attention to me. They followed the stubborn inclinations of their own wicked hearts. They acted worse and worse instead of better."},{"p":4,"t":"From the time your ancestors departed the land of Egypt until now, I sent my servants the prophets to you again and again, day after day."},{"p":4,"t":"But your ancestors did not listen to me nor pay attention to me. They became obstinate and were more wicked than even their own forefathers.’”"},{"p":5,"t":"Then the Lord said to me, “When you tell them all this, they will not listen to you. When you call out to them, they will not respond to you."},{"p":5,"t":"So tell them: ‘This is a nation that has not obeyed the Lord their God and has not accepted correction. Faithfulness is nowhere to be found in it. These people do not even profess it anymore."},{"p":5,"t":"So, mourn, you people of this nation. Cut off your hair and throw it away. Sing a song of mourning on the hilltops. For the Lord has decided to reject and forsake this generation that has provoked his wrath!’”"},{"p":6,"t":"The Lord says, “I have rejected them because the people of Judah have done what I consider evil. They have set up their disgusting idols in the temple which I have claimed for my own and have defiled it."},{"p":6,"t":"They have also built places of worship in a place called Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom so that they can sacrifice their sons and daughters by fire. That is something I never commanded them to do! Indeed, it never even entered my mind to command such a thing!"},{"p":6,"t":"So, watch out!” says the Lord. “The time will soon come when people will no longer call those places Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom. But they will call that valley the Valley of Slaughter and they will bury so many people in Topheth they will run out of room."},{"p":6,"t":"Then the dead bodies of these people will be left on the ground for the birds and wild animals to eat. There will not be any survivors to scare them away."},{"p":6,"t":"I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness, or the glad celebration of brides and grooms throughout the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. For the whole land will become a desolate wasteland.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"The Lord says, “When that time comes, the bones of the kings of Judah and its leaders, the bones of the priests and prophets and of all the other people who lived in Jerusalem will be dug up from their graves."},{"p":1,"t":"They will be spread out and exposed to the sun, the moon and the stars. These are things they adored and served, things to which they paid allegiance, from which they sought guidance, and worshiped. The bones of these people will never be regathered and reburied. They will be like manure used to fertilize the ground."},{"p":1,"t":"However, I will leave some of these wicked people alive and banish them to other places. But wherever these people who survive may go, they will wish they had died rather than lived,” says the Lord who rules over all."},{"p":2,"t":"The Lord said to me, “Tell them, ‘The Lord says, Do people not get back up when they fall down? Do they not turn around when they go the wrong way?"},{"p":3,"t":"Why, then, do these people of Jerusalem continually turn away from me in apostasy? They hold fast to their deception. They refuse to turn back to me."},{"p":4,"t":"I have listened to them very carefully, but they do not speak honestly. None of them regrets the evil he has done. None of them says, “I have done wrong!” All of them persist in their own wayward course like a horse charging recklessly into battle."},{"p":5,"t":"Even the stork knows when it is time to move on. The turtledove, swallow, and crane recognize the normal times for their migration. But my people pay no attention to what I, the Lord, require of them."},{"p":6,"t":"How can you say, “We are wise! We have the law of the Lord”? The truth is, those who teach it have used their writings to make it say what it does not really mean."},{"p":7,"t":"Your wise men will be put to shame. They will be dumbfounded and be brought to judgment. Since they have rejected the word of the Lord, what wisdom do they really have?"},{"p":8,"t":"So I will give their wives to other men and their fields to new owners. For from the least important to the most important of them, all of them are greedy for dishonest gain. Prophets and priests alike, all practice deceit."},{"p":9,"t":"They offer only superficial help for the hurt my dear people have suffered. They say, “Everything will be all right!” But everything is not all right!"},{"p":10,"t":"Are they ashamed because they have done such disgusting things? No, they are not at all ashamed! They do not even know how to blush! So they will die just like others have died. They will be brought to ruin when I punish them, says the Lord."},{"p":11,"t":"I will take away their harvests, says the Lord. There will be no grapes on their vines. There will be no figs on their fig trees. Even the leaves on their trees will wither. The crops that I gave them will be taken away.’”"},{"p":12,"t":"The people say, “Why are we just sitting here? Let us gather together inside the fortified cities. Let us at least die there fighting, since the Lord our God has condemned us to die.

We hoped for a time of relief, but instead we experience terror."},{"p":14,"t":"The snorting of the enemy’s horses is already being heard in the city of Dan. The sound of the neighing of their stallions causes the whole land to tremble with fear. They are coming to destroy the land and everything in it! They are coming to destroy the cities and everyone who lives in them!”"},{"p":15,"t":"The Lord says, “Yes indeed, I am sending an enemy against you that will be like poisonous snakes which cannot be charmed away.

I am sick at heart!"},{"p":17,"t":"I hear my dear people crying out throughout the length and breadth of the land. They are crying, ‘Is the Lord no longer in Zion? Is her divine King no longer there?’” The Lord answers, “Why then do they provoke me to anger with their images, with their worthless foreign idols?”"},{"p":18,"t":"“They cry, ‘Harvest time has come and gone, and the summer is over, and still we have not been delivered.’"},{"p":19,"t":"My heart is crushed because my dear people are being crushed. I go about crying and grieving. I am overwhelmed with dismay."},{"p":20,"t":"There is still medicinal ointment available in Gilead! There is still a physician there! Why then have my dear people not been restored to health?"}],[{"p":1,"t":" I wish that my head were a well full of water and my eyes were a fountain full of tears! If they were, I could cry day and night for those of my dear people who have been killed."},{"p":2,"t":" I wish I had a lodging place in the desert where I could spend some time like a weary traveler.

These people have trained themselves to tell lies. They do wrong and are unable to repent."},{"p":6,"t":"They do one act of violence after another, and one deceitful thing after another. They refuse to pay attention to me,” says the Lord."},{"p":7,"t":"Therefore the Lord who rules over all says, “I will now purify them in the fires of affliction and test them. The wickedness of my dear people has left me no choice. What else can I do?"},{"p":8,"t":"Their tongues are like deadly arrows. They are always telling lies.

They have not obeyed me or followed those laws."},{"p":13,"t":"Instead they have followed the stubborn inclinations of their own hearts. They have paid allegiance to the gods called Baal, as their fathers taught them to do."},{"p":13,"t":"So then, listen to what I, the Lord God of Israel who rules over all, say. ‘I will make these people eat the bitter food of suffering and drink the poison water of judgment."},{"p":13,"t":"I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known anything about. I will send people chasing after them with swords until I have destroyed them.’”"},{"p":14,"t":"The Lord who rules over all told me to say to this people, “Take note of what I say.

Moreover, none of the people of Israel are circumcised when it comes to their hearts.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"You people of Israel, listen to what the Lord has to say to you."},{"p":2,"t":"The Lord says, “Do not start following pagan religious practices.

Instruction from a wooden idol is worthless!"},{"p":9,"t":"Hammered-out silver is brought from Tarshish and gold is brought from Uphaz to cover those idols.

He is the living God and the everlasting King. When he shows his anger the earth shakes. None of the nations can stand up to his fury."},{"p":11,"t":"You people of Israel should tell those nations this: ‘These gods did not make heaven and earth.

Obey the Lord your God. If you do, the Lord will forgo destroying you as he threatened he would."},{"p":4,"t":"As to my case, I am in your power. Do to me what you deem fair and proper."},{"p":4,"t":"But you should take careful note of this: If you put me to death, you will bring on yourselves and this city and those who live in it the guilt of murdering an innocent man.

They said, “This man should not be condemned to die.

They said,"},{"p":5,"t":"“Micah from Moresheth prophesied during the time Hezekiah was king of Judah.

He was kept there for a long time."},{"p":4,"t":"Then King Zedekiah had him brought to the palace.

He said to him,"},{"p":2,"t":"“Your royal Majesty, those men have been very wicked in all that they have done to the prophet Jeremiah. They have thrown him into a cistern and he is sure to die of starvation there because there is no food left in the city."},{"p":2,"t":"Then the king gave Ebed Melech the Ethiopian the following order: “Take thirty men with you from here and go pull the prophet Jeremiah out of the cistern before he dies.”"},{"p":2,"t":"So Ebed Melech took the men with him and went to a room under the treasure room in the palace. He got some worn-out clothes and old rags from there and let them down by ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern."},{"p":2,"t":"Ebed Melech called down to Jeremiah, “Put these rags and worn-out clothes under your armpits to pad the ropes. Jeremiah did as Ebed Melech instructed."},{"p":2,"t":"So they pulled Jeremiah up from the cistern with ropes. Jeremiah, however, still remained confined to the courtyard of the guardhouse."},{"p":3,"t":"Some time later Zedekiah sent and had Jeremiah brought to him at the third entrance of the Lord’s temple. The king said to Jeremiah, “I would like to ask you a question. Do not hide anything from me when you answer.”"},{"p":3,"t":"Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I answer you, you will certainly kill me. If I give you advice, you will not listen to me.”"},{"p":3,"t":"So King Zedekiah made a secret promise to Jeremiah and sealed it with an oath. He promised, “As surely as the Lord lives who has given us life and breath, I promise you this: I will not kill you or hand you over to those men who want to kill you.”"},{"p":4,"t":"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “The Lord, the God who rules over all, the God of Israel, says, ‘You must surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon. If you do, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down. Indeed, you and your whole family will be spared."},{"p":4,"t":"But if you do not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be handed over to the Babylonians and they will burn it down. You yourself will not escape from them.’”"},{"p":4,"t":"Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Babylonians. The Babylonians might hand me over to them and they will torture me.”"},{"p":4,"t":"Then Jeremiah answered, “You will not be handed over to them. Please obey the Lord by doing what I have been telling you. Then all will go well with you and your life will be spared."},{"p":4,"t":"But if you refuse to surrender, the Lord has shown me a vision of what will happen. Here is what I saw:"},{"p":4,"t":"All the women who are left in the royal palace of Judah will be led out to the officers of the king of Babylon. They will taunt you saying, ‘Your trusted friends misled you; they have gotten the best of you. Now that your feet are stuck in the mud, they have turned their backs on you.’"},{"p":5,"t":"“All your wives and your children will be turned over to the Babylonians. You yourself will not escape from them but will be captured by the king of Babylon. This city will be burned down.”"},{"p":6,"t":"Then Zedekiah told Jeremiah, “Do not let anyone know about the conversation we have had. If you do, you will die."},{"p":6,"t":"The officials may hear that I have talked with you. They may come to you and say, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you. Do not hide anything from us. If you do, we will kill you.’"},{"p":6,"t":"If they do this, tell them, ‘I was pleading with the king not to send me back to die in the dungeon of Jonathan’s house.’”"},{"p":6,"t":"All the officials did indeed come and question Jeremiah. He told them exactly what the king had instructed him to say. They stopped questioning him any further because no one had actually heard their conversation."},{"p":6,"t":"So Jeremiah remained confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse until the day Jerusalem was captured.The following events occurred when Jerusalem was captured."}],[{"p":1,"t":"King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against Jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege to it. The siege began in the tenth month of the ninth year that Zedekiah ruled over Judah."},{"p":1,"t":"It lasted until the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year. On that day they broke through the city walls."},{"p":1,"t":"Then Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim, who was a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer, who was a high official, and all the other officers of the king of Babylon came and set up quarters in the Middle Gate."},{"p":1,"t":"When King Zedekiah of Judah and all his soldiers saw them, they tried to escape. They departed from the city during the night. They took a path through the king’s garden and passed out through the gate between the two walls. Then they headed for the Jordan Valley."},{"p":1,"t":"But the Babylonian army chased after them. They caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho and captured him. They took him to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon at Riblah in the territory of Hamath and Nebuchadnezzar passed sentence on him there."},{"p":1,"t":"There at Riblah the king of Babylon had Zedekiah’s sons put to death while Zedekiah was forced to watch. The king of Babylon also had all the nobles of Judah put to death."},{"p":1,"t":"Then he had Zedekiah’s eyes put out and had him bound in chains to be led off to Babylon."},{"p":1,"t":"The Babylonians burned down the royal palace, the temple of the Lord, and the people’s homes, and they tore down the wall of Jerusalem."},{"p":1,"t":"Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, took captive the rest of the people who were left in the city. He carried them off to Babylon along with the people who had deserted to him."},{"p":1,"t":"But he left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing. He gave them fields and vineyards at that time."},{"p":2,"t":"Now King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had issued orders concerning Jeremiah. He had passed them on through Nebuzaradan, the captain of his royal guard,"},{"p":2,"t":"“Find Jeremiah and look out for him. Do not do anything to harm him, but do with him whatever he tells you.”"},{"p":2,"t":"So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, Nebushazban, who was a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer, who was a high official, and all the other officers of the king of Babylon"},{"p":2,"t":"sent and had Jeremiah brought from the courtyard of the guardhouse. They turned him over to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and the grandson of Shaphan, to take him home with him. But Jeremiah stayed among the people."},{"p":3,"t":"Now the Lord had spoken to Jeremiah while he was still confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse,"},{"p":3,"t":"“Go and tell Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, ‘The Lord God of Israel who rules over all says, “I will carry out against this city what I promised. It will mean disaster and not good fortune for it. When that disaster happens, you will be there to see it."},{"p":3,"t":"But I will rescue you when it happens. I, the Lord, affirm it! You will not be handed over to those whom you fear."},{"p":3,"t":"I will certainly save you. You will not fall victim to violence. You will escape with your life because you trust in me. I, the Lord, affirm it!”’”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"The Lord spoke to Jeremiah after Nebuzaradan the captain of the royal guard had set him free at Ramah. He had taken him there in chains along with all the people from Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried off to exile to Babylon."},{"p":1,"t":"The captain of the royal guard took Jeremiah aside and said to him, “The Lord your God threatened this place with this disaster."},{"p":1,"t":"Now he has brought it about. The Lord has done just as he threatened to do. This disaster has happened because you people sinned against the Lord and did not obey him."},{"p":1,"t":"But now, Jeremiah, today I will set you free from the chains on your wrists. If you would like to come to Babylon with me, come along and I will take care of you. But if you prefer not to come to Babylon with me, you are not required to do so. You are free to go anywhere in the land you want to go. Go wherever you choose.”"},{"p":1,"t":"Before Jeremiah could turn to leave, the captain of the guard added, “Go back to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed to govern the towns of Judah. Go back and live with him among the people. Or go wherever else you choose.” Then the captain of the guard gave Jeremiah some food and a present and let him go."},{"p":1,"t":"So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and lived there with him. He stayed there to live among the people who had been left in the land of Judah."},{"p":2,"t":"Now some of the officers of the Judean army and their troops had been hiding in the countryside. They heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam to govern the country. They also heard that he had been put in charge over the men, women, and children from the poorer classes of the land who had not been carried off into exile in Babylon."},{"p":2,"t":"So all these officers and their troops came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. The officers who came were Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite."},{"p":2,"t":"Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, took an oath so as to give them and their troops some assurance of safety. “Do not be afraid to submit to the Babylonians. Settle down in the land and submit to the king of Babylon. Then things will go well for you."},{"p":2,"t":"I for my part will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians whenever they come to us. You for your part go ahead and harvest the wine, the dates, the figs, and the olive oil, and store them in jars. Go ahead and settle down in the towns that you have taken over.”"},{"p":2,"t":"Moreover, all the Judeans who were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and all the other countries heard what had happened. They heard that the king of Babylon had allowed some people to stay in Judah and that he had appointed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, to govern them."},{"p":2,"t":"So all these Judeans returned to the land of Judah from the places where they had been scattered. They came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. Thus they harvested a large amount of wine and dates and figs."},{"p":3,"t":"Johanan and all the officers of the troops that had been hiding in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah."},{"p":3,"t":"They said to him, “Are you at all aware that King Baalis of Ammon has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to kill you?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam would not believe them."},{"p":3,"t":"Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke privately to Gedaliah there at Mizpah, “Let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah before anyone knows about it. Otherwise he will kill you and all the Judeans who have rallied around you will be scattered. Then what remains of Judah will disappear.”"},{"p":3,"t":"But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Do not do that because what you are saying about Ishmael is not true.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"But in the seventh month Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah and grandson of Elishama who was a member of the royal family and had been one of Zedekiah’s chief officers, came with ten of his men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. While they were eating a meal together with him there at Mizpah,"},{"p":1,"t":"Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him stood up, pulled out their swords, and killed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan. Thus Ishmael killed the man that the king of Babylon had appointed to govern the country."},{"p":1,"t":"Ishmael also killed all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah and the Babylonian soldiers who happened to be there."},{"p":2,"t":"On the day after Gedaliah had been murdered, before anyone even knew about it,"},{"p":2,"t":"eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria. They had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes, and cut themselves to show they were mourning. They were carrying grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem."},{"p":2,"t":"Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them. He was pretending to cry as he walked along. When he met them, he said to them, “Come with me to meet Gedaliah son of Ahikam.”"},{"p":2,"t":"But as soon as they were inside the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw their bodies in a cistern."},{"p":2,"t":"But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us. For we will give you the stores of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey we have hidden in a field. So he spared their lives and did not kill them along with the rest."},{"p":2,"t":"Now the cistern where Ishmael threw all the dead bodies of those he had killed was a large one that King Asa had constructed as part of his defenses against King Baasha of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with dead bodies."},{"p":2,"t":"Then Ishmael took captive all the people who were still left alive in Mizpah. This included the royal princesses and all the rest of the people in Mizpah that Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, had put under the authority of Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took all these people captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites."},{"p":3,"t":"Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the atrocities that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed."},{"p":3,"t":"So they took all their troops and went to fight against Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the large pool at Gibeon."},{"p":3,"t":"When all the people that Ishmael had taken captive saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers with him, they were glad."},{"p":3,"t":"All those people that Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah."},{"p":3,"t":"But Ishmael son of Nethaniah managed to escape from Johanan along with eight of his men, and he went on over to Ammon."},{"p":4,"t":"Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led off all the people who had been left alive at Mizpah. They had rescued them from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after he killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. They led off the men, women, children, soldiers, and court officials whom they had brought away from Gibeon."},{"p":4,"t":"They set out to go to Egypt to get away from the Babylonians, but stopped at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem."},{"p":4,"t":"They were afraid of what the Babylonians might do because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed to govern the country."}],[{"p":1,"t":"Then all the army officers, including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah and all the people of every class, went to the prophet Jeremiah."},{"p":1,"t":"They said to him, “Please grant our request and pray to the Lord your God for all those of us who are still left alive here. For, as you yourself can see, there are only a few of us left out of the many there were before."},{"p":1,"t":"Pray that the Lord your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do.”"},{"p":1,"t":"The prophet Jeremiah answered them, “Agreed! I will indeed pray to the Lord your God as you have asked. I will tell you everything the Lord replies in response to you. I will not keep anything back from you.”"},{"p":1,"t":"They answered Jeremiah, “May the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not do just as the Lord sends you to tell us to do."},{"p":1,"t":"We will obey what the Lord our God to whom we are sending you tells us to do. It does not matter whether we like what he tells us or not. We will obey what he tells us to do so that things will go well for us.”"},{"p":2,"t":"Ten days later the Lord spoke to Jeremiah."},{"p":2,"t":"So Jeremiah summoned Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people of every class."},{"p":2,"t":"Then Jeremiah said to them, “You sent me to the Lord God of Israel to make your request known to him. Here is what he says to you:"},{"p":2,"t":"‘If you will just stay in this land, I will build you up. I will not tear you down. I will firmly plant you. I will not uproot you. For I am filled with sorrow because of the disaster that I have brought on you."},{"p":2,"t":"Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon whom you now fear. Do not be afraid of him because I will be with you to save you and to rescue you from his power. I, the Lord, affirm it!"},{"p":2,"t":"I will have compassion on you so that he in turn will have mercy on you and allow you to return to your land.’"},{"p":3,"t":"“You must not disobey the Lord your God by saying, ‘We will not stay in this land.’"},{"p":3,"t":"You must not say, ‘No, we will not stay. Instead we will go and live in the land of Egypt where we will not face war, or hear the enemy’s trumpet calls, or starve for lack of food.’"},{"p":3,"t":"If you people who remain in Judah do that, then listen to what the Lord says. The Lord God of Israel who rules over all says, ‘If you are so determined to go to Egypt that you go and settle there,"},{"p":3,"t":"the wars you fear will catch up with you there in the land of Egypt. The starvation you are worried about will follow you there to Egypt. You will die there."},{"p":3,"t":"All the people who are determined to go and settle in Egypt will die from war, starvation, or disease. No one will survive or escape the disaster I will bring on them.’"},{"p":3,"t":"For the Lord God of Israel who rules over all says, ‘If you go to Egypt, I will pour out my wrath on you just as I poured out my anger and wrath on the citizens of Jerusalem.

You will never see this place again.’"},{"p":4,"t":"“The Lord has told you people who remain in Judah, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ Be very sure of this: I warn you here and now."},{"p":4,"t":"You are making a fatal mistake. For you sent me to the Lord your God and asked me, ‘Pray to the Lord our God for us. Tell us what the Lord our God says and we will do it.’"},{"p":4,"t":"This day I have told you what he said. But you do not want to obey the Lord by doing what he sent me to tell you."},{"p":4,"t":"So now be very sure of this: You will die from war, starvation, or disease in the place where you want to go and live.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"Jeremiah finished telling all the people all these things the Lord their God had sent him to tell them."},{"p":1,"t":"Then Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and other arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie! The Lord our God did not send you to tell us, ‘You must not go to Egypt and settle there.’"},{"p":1,"t":"But Baruch son of Neriah is stirring you up against us. He wants to hand us over to the Babylonians so that they will kill us or carry us off into exile in Babylon.”"},{"p":1,"t":"So Johanan son of Kareah, all the army officers, and all the rest of the people did not obey the Lord’s command to stay in the land."},{"p":1,"t":"Instead Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led off all the Judean remnant who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered."},{"p":1,"t":"They also led off all the men, women, children, and royal princesses that Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, had left with Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan.
