Bashan and Carmel wither; the blossom of Lebanon withers."},{"p":5,"t":"The mountains tremble before him, the hills convulse; the earth is laid waste before him, the world and all its inhabitants are laid waste."},{"p":6,"t":"No one can withstand his indignation! No one can resist his fierce anger! His wrath is poured out like volcanic fire, boulders are broken up as he approaches."},{"p":7,"t":"The Lord is good &#8211; indeed, he is a fortress in time of distress, and he protects those who seek refuge in him."},{"p":8,"t":"But with an overwhelming flood he will make a complete end of Nineveh; he will drive his enemies into darkness."},{"p":9,"t":"Whatever you plot against the Lord, he will completely destroy! Distress will not arise a second time."},{"p":10,"t":"Surely they will be totally consumed like entangled thorn bushes, like the drink of drunkards, like very dry stubble."},{"p":11,"t":"From you, O Nineveh, one has marched forth who plots evil against the Lord, a wicked military strategist."},{"p":12,"t":"This is what the Lord says: “Even though they are powerful &#8211; and what is more, even though their army is numerous &#8211; nevertheless, they will be destroyed and trickle away!

Who will lament for her?’ There will be no one to comfort you!”"},{"p":8,"t":"You are no more secure than Thebes &#8211; she was located on the banks of the Nile; the waters surrounded her, her rampart was the sea, the water was her wall."},{"p":9,"t":"Cush and Egypt had limitless strength; Put and the Libyans were among her allies."},{"p":10,"t":"Yet she went into captivity as an exile; even her infants were smashed to pieces at the head of every street.
