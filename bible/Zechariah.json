They will call on my name and I will answer; I will say, ‘These are my people,’ and they will say, ‘The Lord is my God.’”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"A day of the Lord is about to come when your possessions will be divided as plunder in your midst."},{"p":1,"t":"For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to wage war; the city will be taken, its houses plundered, and the women raped. Then half of the city will go into exile, but the remainder of the people will not be taken away."},{"p":2,"t":"Then the Lord will go to battle and fight against those nations, just as he fought battles in ancient days."},{"p":2,"t":"On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives which lies to the east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in half from east to west, leaving a great valley. Half the mountain will move northward and the other half southward."},{"p":2,"t":"Then you will escape through my mountain valley, for the mountains will extend to Azal. Indeed, you will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of King Uzziah of Judah.
