From now on I will go to the Gentiles!”"},{"p":2,"t":"Then Paul left the synagogue and went to the house of a person named Titius Justus, a Gentile who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue."},{"p":2,"t":"Crispus, the president of the synagogue, believed in the Lord together with his entire household, and many of the Corinthians who heard about it believed and were baptized."},{"p":2,"t":"The Lord said to Paul by a vision in the night, “Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent,"},{"p":2,"t":"because I am with you, and no one will assault you to harm you, because I have many people in this city.”"},{"p":2,"t":"So he stayed there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them."},{"p":3,"t":"Now while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews attacked Paul together and brought him before the judgment seat,"},{"p":3,"t":"saying, “This man is persuading people to worship God in a way contrary to the law!”"},{"p":3,"t":"But just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it were a matter of some crime or serious piece of villainy, I would have been justified in accepting the complaint of you Jews,"},{"p":3,"t":"but since it concerns points of disagreement about words and names and your own law, settle it yourselves. I will not be a judge of these things!”"},{"p":3,"t":"Then he had them forced away from the judgment seat."},{"p":3,"t":"So they all seized Sosthenes, the president of the synagogue, and began to beat him in front of the judgment seat. Yet none of these things were of any concern to Gallio."},{"p":4,"t":"Paul, after staying many more days in Corinth, said farewell to the brothers and sailed away to Syria accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. He had his hair cut off at Cenchrea because he had made a vow."},{"p":4,"t":"When they reached Ephesus, Paul left Priscilla and Aquila behind there, but he himself went into the synagogue and addressed the Jews."},{"p":4,"t":"When they asked him to stay longer, he would not consent,"},{"p":4,"t":"but said farewell to them and added, “I will come back to you again if God wills.” Then he set sail from Ephesus,"},{"p":4,"t":"and when he arrived at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church at Jerusalem and then went down to Antioch."},{"p":4,"t":"After he spent some time there, Paul left and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples."},{"p":5,"t":"Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, arrived in Ephesus. He was an eloquent speaker, well-versed in the scriptures."},{"p":5,"t":"He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and with great enthusiasm he spoke and taught accurately the facts about Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John."},{"p":5,"t":"He began to speak out fearlessly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained the way of God to him more accurately."},{"p":5,"t":"When Apollos wanted to cross over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, he assisted greatly those who had believed by grace,"},{"p":5,"t":"for he refuted the Jews vigorously in public debate, demonstrating from the scriptures that the Christ was Jesus."}],[{"p":1,"t":"While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul went through the inland regions and came to Ephesus. He found some disciples there"},{"p":1,"t":"and said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” They replied, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”"},{"p":1,"t":"So Paul said, “Into what then were you baptized?” “Into John’s baptism,” they replied."},{"p":1,"t":"Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.”"},{"p":1,"t":"When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,"},{"p":1,"t":"and when Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy."},{"p":1,"t":"(Now there were about twelve men in all.)"},{"p":2,"t":"So Paul entered the synagogue and spoke out fearlessly for three months, addressing and convincing them about the kingdom of God."},{"p":2,"t":"But when some were stubborn and refused to believe, reviling the Way before the congregation, he left them and took the disciples with him, addressing them every day in the lecture hall of Tyrannus."},{"p":2,"t":"This went on for two years, so that all who lived in the province of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord."},{"p":3,"t":"God was performing extraordinary miracles by Paul’s hands,"},{"p":3,"t":"so that when even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his body were brought to the sick, their diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them."},{"p":3,"t":"But some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were possessed by evil spirits, saying, “I sternly warn you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.”"},{"p":3,"t":"(Now seven sons of a man named Sceva, a Jewish high priest, were doing this.)"},{"p":3,"t":"But the evil spirit replied to them, “I know about Jesus and I am acquainted with Paul, but who are you?”"},{"p":3,"t":"Then the man who was possessed by the evil spirit jumped on them and beat them all into submission. He prevailed against them so that they fled from that house naked and wounded."},{"p":3,"t":"This became known to all who lived in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks; fear came over them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was praised."},{"p":3,"t":"Many of those who had believed came forward, confessing and making their deeds known."},{"p":3,"t":"Large numbers of those who had practiced magic collected their books and burned them up in the presence of everyone. When the value of the books was added up, it was found to total fifty thousand silver coins."},{"p":3,"t":"In this way the word of the Lord continued to grow in power and to prevail."},{"p":4,"t":"Now after all these things had taken place, Paul resolved to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia.

speak, Paul replied, “Because I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I confidently make my defense."},{"p":2,"t":"As you can verify for yourself, not more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship."},{"p":2,"t":"They did not find me arguing with anyone or stirring up a crowd in the temple courts or in the synagogues or throughout the city,"},{"p":2,"t":"nor can they prove to you the things they are accusing me of doing."},{"p":2,"t":"But I confess this to you, that I worship the God of our ancestors according to the Way (which they call a sect), believing everything that is according to the law and that is written in the prophets."},{"p":2,"t":"I have a hope in God (a hope that these men themselves accept too) that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous."},{"p":2,"t":"This is the reason I do my best to always have a clear conscience toward God and toward people."},{"p":2,"t":"After several years I came to bring to my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings,"},{"p":2,"t":"which I was doing when they found me in the temple, ritually purified, without a crowd or a disturbance."},{"p":2,"t":"But there are some Jews from the province of Asia who should be here before you and bring charges, if they have anything against me."},{"p":2,"t":"Or these men here should tell what crime they found me guilty of when I stood before the council,"},{"p":2,"t":"other than this one thing I shouted out while I stood before them: ‘I am on trial before you today concerning the resurrection of the dead.’”"},{"p":3,"t":"Then Felix, who understood the facts concerning the Way more accurately, adjourned their hearing, saying, “When Lysias the commanding officer comes down, I will decide your case.”"},{"p":3,"t":"He ordered the centurion to guard Paul, but to let him have some freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from meeting his needs."},{"p":4,"t":"Some days later, when Felix arrived with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus."},{"p":4,"t":"While Paul was discussing righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became frightened and said, “Go away for now, and when I have an opportunity, I will send for you.”"},{"p":4,"t":"At the same time he was also hoping that Paul would give him money, and for this reason he sent for Paul as often as possible and talked with him."},{"p":4,"t":"After two years had passed, Porcius Festus succeeded Felix, and because he wanted to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison."}],[{"p":1,"t":"Now three days after Festus arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea."},{"p":1,"t":"So the chief priests and the most prominent men of the Jews brought formal charges against Paul to him."},{"p":1,"t":"Requesting him to do them a favor against Paul, they urged Festus to summon him to Jerusalem, planning an ambush to kill him along the way."},{"p":1,"t":"Then Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and he himself intended to go there shortly."},{"p":1,"t":"“So,” he said, “let your leaders go down there with me, and if this man has done anything wrong, they may bring charges against him.”"},{"p":2,"t":"After Festus had stayed not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and the next day he sat on the judgment seat and ordered Paul to be brought."},{"p":2,"t":"When he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges that they were not able to prove."},{"p":2,"t":"Paul said in his defense, “I have committed no offense against the Jewish law or against the temple or against Caesar.”"},{"p":2,"t":"But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, asked Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be tried before me there on these charges?”"},{"p":2,"t":"Paul replied, “I am standing before Caesar’s judgment seat, where I should be tried. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well."},{"p":2,"t":"If then I am in the wrong and have done anything that deserves death, I am not trying to escape dying, but if not one of their charges against me is true, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!”"},{"p":2,"t":"Then, after conferring with his council, Festus replied, “You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you will go!”"},{"p":3,"t":"After several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus."},{"p":3,"t":"While they were staying there many days, Festus explained Paul’s case to the king to get his opinion, saying, “There is a man left here as a prisoner by Felix."},{"p":3,"t":"When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him."},{"p":3,"t":"I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to hand over anyone before the accused had met his accusers face to face and had been given an opportunity to make a defense against the accusation."},{"p":3,"t":"So after they came back here with me, I did not postpone the case, but the next day I sat on the judgment seat and ordered the man to be brought."},{"p":3,"t":"When his accusers stood up, they did not charge him with any of the evil deeds I had suspected."},{"p":3,"t":"Rather they had several points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a man named Jesus who was dead, whom Paul claimed to be alive."},{"p":3,"t":"Because I was at a loss how I could investigate these matters, I asked if he were willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on these charges."},{"p":3,"t":"But when Paul appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of His Majesty the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept under guard until I could send him to Caesar.”"},{"p":3,"t":"Agrippa said to Festus, “I would also like to hear the man myself.” “Tomorrow,” he replied, “you will hear him.”"},{"p":4,"t":"So the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience hall, along with the senior military officers and the prominent men of the city. When Festus gave the order, Paul was brought in."},{"p":4,"t":"Then Festus said, “King Agrippa, and all you who are present here with us, you see this man about whom the entire Jewish populace petitioned me both in Jerusalem and here, shouting loudly that he ought not to live any longer."},{"p":4,"t":"But I found that he had done nothing that deserved death, and when he appealed to His Majesty the Emperor, I decided to send him."},{"p":4,"t":"But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after this preliminary hearing I may have something to write."},{"p":4,"t":"For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner without clearly indicating the charges against him.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"So Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.” Then Paul held out his hand and began his defense:"},{"p":2,"t":"“Regarding all the things I have been accused of by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that I am about to make my defense before you today,"},{"p":2,"t":"because you are especially familiar with all the customs and controversial issues of the Jews. Therefore I ask you to listen to me patiently."},{"p":2,"t":"Now all the Jews know the way I lived from my youth, spending my life from the beginning among my own people and in Jerusalem."},{"p":2,"t":"They know, because they have known me from time past, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion, I lived as a Pharisee."},{"p":2,"t":"And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise made by God to our ancestors,"},{"p":2,"t":"a promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly serve God night and day. Concerning this hope the Jews are accusing me, Your Majesty!"},{"p":2,"t":"Why do you people think it is unbelievable that God raises the dead?"},{"p":2,"t":"Of course, I myself was convinced that it was necessary to do many things hostile to the name of Jesus the Nazarene."},{"p":2,"t":"And that is what I did in Jerusalem: Not only did I lock up many of the saints in prisons by the authority I received from the chief priests, but I also cast my vote against them when they were sentenced to death."},{"p":2,"t":"I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to force them to blaspheme. Because I was so furiously enraged at them, I went to persecute them even in foreign cities."},{"p":3,"t":"“While doing this very thing, as I was going to Damascus with authority and complete power from the chief priests,"},{"p":3,"t":"about noon along the road, Your Majesty, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining everywhere around me and those traveling with me."},{"p":3,"t":"When we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? You are hurting yourself by kicking against the goads.’"},{"p":3,"t":"So I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord replied, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting."},{"p":3,"t":"But get up and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this reason, to designate you in advance as a servant and witness to the things you have seen and to the things in which I will appear to you."},{"p":3,"t":"I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you"},{"p":3,"t":"to open their eyes so that they turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’"},{"p":4,"t":"“Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,"},{"p":4,"t":"but I declared to those in Damascus first, and then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds consistent with repentance."},{"p":4,"t":"For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple courts and were trying to kill me."},{"p":4,"t":"I have experienced help from God to this day, and so I stand testifying to both small and great, saying nothing except what the prophets and Moses said was going to happen:"},{"p":4,"t":"that the Christ was to suffer and be the first to rise from the dead, to proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles.”"},{"p":5,"t":"As Paul was saying these things in his defense, Festus exclaimed loudly, “You have lost your mind, Paul! Your great learning is driving you insane!”"},{"p":5,"t":"But Paul replied, “I have not lost my mind, most excellent Festus, but am speaking true and rational words."},{"p":5,"t":"For the king knows about these things, and I am speaking freely to him, because I cannot believe that any of these things has escaped his notice, for this was not done in a corner."},{"p":5,"t":"Do you believe the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you believe.”"},{"p":5,"t":"Agrippa said to Paul, “In such a short time are you persuading me to become a Christian?”"},{"p":5,"t":"Paul replied, “I pray to God that whether in a short or a long time not only you but also all those who are listening to me today could become such as I am, except for these chains.”"},{"p":6,"t":"So the king got up, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them,"},{"p":6,"t":"and as they were leaving they said to one another, “This man is not doing anything deserving death or imprisonment.”"},{"p":6,"t":"Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.”"}],[{"p":1,"t":"When it was decided we would sail to Italy, they handed over Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort named Julius."},{"p":1,"t":"We went on board a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to various ports along the coast of the province of Asia and put out to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica."},{"p":1,"t":"The next day we put in at Sidon, and Julius, treating Paul kindly, allowed him to go to his friends so they could provide him with what he needed."},{"p":1,"t":"From there we put out to sea and sailed under the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us."},{"p":1,"t":"After we had sailed across the open sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we put in at Myra in Lycia."},{"p":1,"t":"There the centurion found a ship from Alexandria sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it."},{"p":1,"t":"We sailed slowly for many days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus. Because the wind prevented us from going any farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone."},{"p":1,"t":"With difficulty we sailed along the coast of Crete and came to a place called Fair Havens that was near the town of Lasea."},{"p":2,"t":"Since considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous because the fast was already over, Paul advised them,"},{"p":2,"t":"“Men, I can see the voyage is going to end in disaster and great loss not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.”"},{"p":2,"t":"But the centurion was more convinced by the captain and the ship’s owner than by what Paul said."},{"p":2,"t":"Because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in, the majority decided to put out to sea from there. They hoped that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there."},{"p":2,"t":"When a gentle south wind sprang up, they thought they could carry out their purpose, so they weighed anchor and sailed close along the coast of Crete."},{"p":2,"t":"Not long after this, a hurricane-force wind called the northeaster blew down from the island."},{"p":2,"t":"When the ship was caught in it and could not head into the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along."},{"p":2,"t":"As we ran under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able with difficulty to get the ship’s boat under control."},{"p":2,"t":"After the crew had hoisted it aboard, they used supports to undergird the ship. Fearing they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor, thus letting themselves be driven along."},{"p":2,"t":"The next day, because we were violently battered by the storm, they began throwing the cargo overboard,"},{"p":2,"t":"and on the third day they threw the ship’s gear overboard with their own hands."},{"p":2,"t":"When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and a violent storm continued to batter us, we finally abandoned all hope of being saved."},{"p":3,"t":"Since many of them had no desire to eat, Paul stood up among them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me and not put out to sea from Crete, thus avoiding this damage and loss."},{"p":3,"t":"And now I advise you to keep up your courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only the ship will be lost."},{"p":3,"t":"For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve came to me"},{"p":3,"t":"and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul! You must stand before Caesar, and God has graciously granted you the safety of all who are sailing with you.’"},{"p":3,"t":"Therefore keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will be just as I have been told."},{"p":3,"t":"But we must run aground on some island.”"},{"p":4,"t":"When the fourteenth night had come, while we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors suspected they were approaching some land."},{"p":4,"t":"They took soundings and found the water was twenty fathoms deep; when they had sailed a little farther they took soundings again and found it was fifteen fathoms deep."},{"p":4,"t":"Because they were afraid that we would run aground on the rocky coast, they threw out four anchors from the stern and wished for day to appear."},{"p":4,"t":"Then when the sailors tried to escape from the ship and were lowering the ship’s boat into the sea, pretending that they were going to put out anchors from the bow,"},{"p":4,"t":"Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.”"},{"p":4,"t":"Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the ship’s boat and let it drift away."},{"p":5,"t":"As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day you have been in suspense and have gone without food; you have eaten nothing."},{"p":5,"t":"Therefore I urge you to take some food, for this is important for your survival. For not one of you will lose a hair from his head.”"},{"p":5,"t":"After he said this, Paul took bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all, broke it, and began to eat."},{"p":5,"t":"So all of them were encouraged and took food themselves."},{"p":5,"t":"(We were in all two hundred seventy-six persons on the ship.)"},{"p":5,"t":"When they had eaten enough to be satisfied, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea."},{"p":6,"t":"When day came, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could."},{"p":6,"t":"So they slipped the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the linkage that bound the steering oars together. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and steered toward the beach."},{"p":6,"t":"But they encountered a patch of crosscurrents and ran the ship aground; the bow stuck fast and could not be moved, but the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves."},{"p":6,"t":"Now the soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners so that none of them would escape by swimming away."},{"p":6,"t":"But the centurion, wanting to save Paul’s life, prevented them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land,"},{"p":6,"t":"and the rest were to follow, some on planks and some on pieces of the ship. And in this way all were brought safely to land."}],[{"p":1,"t":"After we had safely reached shore, we learned that the island was called Malta."},{"p":1,"t":"The local inhabitants showed us extraordinary kindness, for they built a fire and welcomed us all because it had started to rain and was cold."},{"p":1,"t":"When Paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood and was putting it on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand."},{"p":1,"t":"When the local people saw the creature hanging from Paul’s hand, they said to one another, “No doubt this man is a murderer! Although he has escaped from the sea, Justice herself has not allowed him to live!”"},{"p":1,"t":"However, Paul shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm."},{"p":1,"t":"But they were expecting that he was going to swell up or suddenly drop dead. So after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god."},{"p":2,"t":"Now in the region around that place were fields belonging to the chief official of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us hospitably as guests for three days."},{"p":2,"t":"The father of Publius lay sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and after praying, placed his hands on him and healed him."},{"p":2,"t":"After this had happened, many of the people on the island who were sick also came and were healed."},{"p":2,"t":"They also bestowed many honors, and when we were preparing to sail, they gave us all the supplies we needed."},{"p":3,"t":"After three months we put out to sea in an Alexandrian ship that had wintered at the island and had the “Heavenly Twins” as its figurehead."},{"p":3,"t":"We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days."},{"p":3,"t":"From there we cast off and arrived at Rhegium, and after one day a south wind sprang up and on the second day we came to Puteoli."},{"p":3,"t":"There we found some brothers and were invited to stay with them seven days. And in this way we came to Rome."},{"p":3,"t":"The brothers from there, when they heard about us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. When he saw them, Paul thanked God and took courage."},{"p":3,"t":"When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him."},{"p":4,"t":"After three days Paul called the local Jewish leaders together. When they had assembled, he said to them, “Brothers, although I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors, from Jerusalem I was handed over as a prisoner to the Romans."},{"p":4,"t":"When they had heard my case, they wanted to release me, because there was no basis for a death sentence against me."},{"p":4,"t":"But when the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar &#8211; not that I had some charge to bring against my own people."},{"p":4,"t":"So for this reason I have asked to see you and speak with you, for I am bound with this chain because of the hope of Israel.”"},{"p":4,"t":"They replied, “We have received no letters from Judea about you, nor have any of the brothers come from there and reported or said anything bad about you."},{"p":4,"t":"But we would like to hear from you what you think, for regarding this sect we know that people everywhere speak against it.”"},{"p":5,"t":"They set a day to meet with him, and they came to him where he was staying in even greater numbers. From morning until evening he explained things to them, testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus from both the law of Moses and the prophets."},{"p":5,"t":"Some were convinced by what he said, but others refused to believe."},{"p":5,"t":"So they began to leave, unable to agree among themselves, after Paul made one last statement: “The Holy Spirit spoke rightly to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah"},{"p":5,"t":"when he said, ‘<b>Go to this people and say,</b> “<b>You will keep on hearing,</b> <b>but will never understand,</b> <b>and you will keep on looking,</b> <b>but will never perceive</b>."},{"p":6,"t":"<b>For the heart of this people has become dull,</b> <b>and their ears are hard of hearing,</b> <b>and they have closed their eyes,</b> <b>so that they would not see with their eyes</b> <b>and hear with their ears</b> <b>and understand with their heart</b> <b>and turn,</b> <b>and I would heal them</b>.”’"},{"p":7,"t":"“Therefore be advised that this salvation from God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen!”"},{"p":8,"t":"[[EMPTY]]"},{"p":8,"t":"Paul lived there two whole years in his own rented quarters and welcomed all who came to him,"},{"p":8,"t":"proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with complete boldness and without restriction."}]]
