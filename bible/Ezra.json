The hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from our enemy and from bandits along the way."},{"p":20,"t":"So we came to Jerusalem, and we stayed there for three days."},{"p":20,"t":"On the fourth day we weighed out the silver, the gold, and the vessels in the house of our God into the care of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest, and Eleazar son of Phinehas, who were accompanied by Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui, who were Levites."},{"p":20,"t":"Everything was verified by number and by weight, and the total weight was written down at that time."},{"p":21,"t":"The exiles who were returning from the captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel &#8211; twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs, along with twelve male goats as a sin offering.

Devastated, I continued to sit there until the evening offering."},{"p":3,"t":"At the time of the evening offering I got up from my self-abasement, with my tunic and robe torn, and then dropped to my knees and spread my hands to the Lord my God."},{"p":3,"t":"I prayed, “O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift my face to you, my God! For our iniquities have climbed higher than our heads, and our guilt extends to the heavens."},{"p":4,"t":"From the days of our fathers until this very day our guilt has been great.

Even so, our God, you have exercised restraint toward our iniquities and have given us a remnant such as this."},{"p":7,"t":"Shall we once again break your commandments and intermarry with these abominable peoples? Would you not be so angered by us that you would wipe us out, with no survivor or remnant?"},{"p":7,"t":"O Lord God of Israel, you are righteous, for we are left as a remnant this day.
